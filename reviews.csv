Gary Danko,"Restaurant Gary Danko is our favorite restaurant in the world.  We come to San Francisco once a year and we always make a reservation at RGD.  It NEVER disappoints.  The  food, service and the atmosphere are always great.  From when our party walks in the door, we always feel welcome.  The food and drink are always great,  I could go on and on with great accolades about the restaurant.  In the interest of brevity, I will not.

Gary Danko,"Most of the food was very good. I wan not impressed with soufflé unfortunately, I was really looking forward to trying that. It lacked flavor and the texture was kind of like a cake pudding. Just not a hit for me. The Japanese sweet potato that came with the seared scallops was so damn good. I would have loved to have more of the Yuzu sauce with it. Seriously that was potato was so delicious. The steak and potato dish was also good, and so was the risotto. The soup sample and little ""appeasement bite"" that was served were also delicious. I did not enjoy either of the cocktails that I tasted, but that's okay. I don't remember my server's name, but she was absolutely fantastic. And so was everyone else that stopped by out table. I will absolutely come back again for a date night or anniversary.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko continues to shine after more than 25 years in business! The service is so elevated, it is like no other restaurant in San Francisco. The menu is broad and it’s difficult to choose between options, but everything you order will be simply amazing!
We ordered the lobster salad, seafood risotto, lamb loin and filet of beef. Each course was beautifully presented and sumptuously prepared. We found room in our appetites for the cheese board(don’t miss this!) and profiteroles and sorbet trio. It was all mouthwatering. They have an extensive wine list and we are connoisseur of wine, but ordered two wines we have never had before and they were fantastic.
Because it was our anniversary we were also treated with an additional complementary mini deserts, each a burst of flavor.
Every diner also got a very nice surprise to take home and enjoy the next day and we surely did !

Gary Danko,"We had a fantastic evening w another couple-- close friends. So, party of 4. We've been many times in the past-- this might have been our favorite time. The caviar service is very special-- the buckwheat blinis are DELICIOUS. Cannot recommend them highly enough. You won't  regret it. Get 1 Oz of the lowest one as appetizer to share. Super fun, fantastic way to start.

Love how each person can lick whatever they want, any course any time. 3, 4, or 5 courses. Recommend 3 if w the caviar. Could do 4 course if no caviar course. The lobster risotto is amazing. So is the roasted lobster. My husband loved the pork tenderloin.

The Soufflés are delicious . Cheese cart:course is one-of-a-kind, if you like cheese.  Our friend was delighted.

The service was impeccable, outstanding.

We will be back again sometime for a special meal.  It is incredibly reasonable for the quality and quantity honestly of food. 5 star everything. Highly highly recommend. Beautiful ambiance , w the lighting, art, table spacing, floral arrangements, even the restroom : )  perfect for great conversation.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We had a very good dinner at Gary Danko with excellent service from entrance to exit.  The place was very busy yet there was always someone right at the table before you thought to look for anyone

What was missing from my previous visit several years ago was the intensity of superb flavors that were groan inducing. The food just wasn’t over the top incredible with flavors that combined in excellence.

. My appetizer duck confit salad contained some dry shredded duck. The rest of the salad included a lot of delicious greens but the fruit was sour and missed pairing well. Dressing was delicious and all ingredients were beautifully fresh and well served.

My roast lobster was very nice but not exceptional. The mashed potato and sweet corn that accompanied it were also good. My filet steak was incredibly tender and that was extremely good and approached the quality of the previous visit. What I missed was the incredible reduction that had been served previously and mushroom flavor intensity.

My dessert was frankly disappointing. It was supposed to be hazelnut Mille-feuille with layers of puff pastry. There wasn’t a puff in sight. The layers were hard and flat with no flakiness at all. I left most of it on the plate.

We left most of the complementary tiny desserts served at the end of dinner. The tiny pillow of key lime pie was delicious but The chocolate one I tried was burnt black at the bottom and not palatable. It is such a shame that the kitchen has lost its inspiration and quality control as everything else is brilliant.

I probably won’t go back. I understand why they lost their Michelin star. It is a lot of money to not be wowed. The meal was $400 for two without any wineRead more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"We love this place. It's pricey but for a special occasion, it's great! Our wait staff was attentive and the food was outstanding. I was initially ready to order an appetizer and two main dishes but I followed my girlfriends lead and only ordered 1 main. This was a good thing as the portions are quite substantial; not huge but more than I had expected. We can't wait to visit again!",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Amazing experience, from the moment getting there until the end. They called me and let me know they opened up a spot for me to park right outside of restaurant. They greeted me and they har prepared a nice table for me and my girl. The service was next level. Food was amazing. All around one of the best dining experiences if you are willing to splurge:)",Overall5
Gary Danko,"First tasted Chef Danko’s delicious cuisine in late 20th century when he was @ San Francisco Ritz Hotel’s dining room.  Was delighted when he opened his own restaurant in San Francisco on North Point and Hyde—2 blocks from my apartment (Chestnut & Hyde)!  Currently live in Manhattan but visiting my sister, who lives 2 blocks from Danko’s @ on Leavenworth and Bay!  Talk about good fortune, it’s a great treat to be able to enjoy such exquisite cuisine so nearby!!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"In brief, our table was not ready when we arrived so we waited 20 minutes at the bar.  We were not drinking and non alcoholic options were thin.  Given a table and then another “better” one opened after we had started dinner and the hostess suggested to move again.  But interrupted to do so.  The waiter was mildly aggressive in order taking—we were two people and I ordered for both of us which seemed to confuse him.  He called me buddy which does not seem like an appropriate way to address a woman in her 50’s and I later asked him if he called everyone which he said yes to.  He apologised however.  At one point I had asked a man who appeared to be the floor manager for a knife which didn’t come, so I got up and went over to where he was socialising with 5 other waiters and asked again and his response was ‘oh didn’t X get it for you’.  I noted that X was busy, had just gone into the kitchen and that he was standing right in front of the knives.  Random waiters would come by our table asking if we wanted to have our food cleared and put in doggie bags.  It happened at every course and before we had finished.  It was all just a bit off and slightly aggressive.  Some of the fishes were very good but the lobster was not: an enormous quantity of overcooked rice with no identifiable traces of lobster.  I do not believe this restaurant deserves a Michelin star.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"Extremely hospitable, courteous, professional. Tasting menu not as interesting as I would have expected. A La Carte selections were very good. Salad of panko deep fried egg over baby chicory best green assemblage I have ever tasted. Scallops were good but too potatoe-heavy(overwhelmed by Japanese sweet potato with yuzu). My wife completely enjoyed the lobster salad and entree. Also, she raved about the duck. The chocolate soufflés were absolutely exquisite. Perfect preparation. Most probably the best I have ever tasted, in any flavor. Pastry chef is extremely skillful. Cheese offerings very broad range. Very ice to see a truly classic cheese service. Worth a revisit, undoubtedly. Price not bad at all for this level of professionalism in San Francisco.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Gary Danko restaurant is one of the finest restaurants in San Francisco, maybe in the USA.  Each dish is original and magnificent.  Basically you have a bunch of appetizers to choose from, a seafood section, a meat section for entrees and a dessert  section.  For two people, we chose four appetizers to share and two Appetizers were the Duck Confit, the Seared Ahi, the Vegetqble Tart, and the Tomato Gaspacho,  and all were exceptional.  The Duck confit was like a salad, too.   They start you with a small taste of mushroom soup to whet your appetites.  The wines by the glass are  great, but they have a full bar.   We chose the branzino and the lamb entrees.  They were delicious dishes and beautifully presented on the plates.  The portions aren’t large, but they are sufficient and leave you feeling satisfied.  Oh, and the desserts were amazing!  The service at this restaurant is what you would expect from such fine dining!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,An evening at Gary Danko is a culinary experience!,Overall5
Gary Danko,"We loved that we could customize the fixed-price menu to select 3, 4, or 5 items. The Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer, Seared Scallops with Japanese Sweet Potato, and Chocolate Soufflé were exquisite. Service was excellent and it was a nice touch that they provided ""extras"" like soup, dessert samples, and a take home gift.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"The food is always very tasty.  It was a bit loud for me this time.  Other visits it was quieter.  Still a nice experience, we didn’t have to yell to have a conversation.  Service makes this experience the best as always when here.  Too bad parking in SF is difficult, we would come more often.",Overall5

It was such a great experience.

Gary Danko,"On the whole, the first three courses were good. We had the beef tartare, tuna, scallops, quail and fillet. They appear to handle protein very well. The potato gratin was noxious. Poor flavor and awful texture. The dessert was a disappointment . No confetti for their confectionery.  Apologies, I won’t be rushing back.",Overall4

It was exquisite service from the moment I stepped inside. The price point is considerably reasonable, and with 3 course 4, course and 5 course options (I sprang for 4!).

Caviar service was sloppy and Bellinis Burt….it felt like a tourist attraction and f or the price, no longer worth it. After 20 years I will not be back.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"We have dined at Gary Danko several times since its opening.  Everything about it is outstanding - the food, service, and ambience.

Gary Danko,"Was not seated until 50 minutes past our reservation. The hostess ignored us and the problem.

Gary Danko,Great for special occasions. Food is excellent and the service is over the top great.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"It was a price-y and lavish affair, but sometimes that's worth it for special occasions, and of all of the places we've spent that kind of money on food, Gary Danko was probably the best one I've experienced. Everything we had was absolutely delicious and the staff was beyond professional - friendly and attentive without being annoying, and quite accommodating for our bizarre needs as well (my wife and I had gone to a painting class right before dinner and they gracefully took care of our still-wet paintings while we dined without batting an eye). 

A lovely evening with delicious food and drink. I recommend the seared tuna app, the horseradish salmon, and the trio of creme brulee for desert (or the Hazelnut Mille-Feuille was equally delicious). And the cocktail is a new favorite (the name I can't recall, but it was something like This Is Not A Call, tequia-based with mango, avocado and sesame. Absolutely deliciousRead more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"I had never been to Gary Danko before. I just learned of it in August of this year. It was our 11th wedding anniversary and the staff made sure we felt special and celebrated. The shrimp and lobster risotto was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I had the filet and my husband had the lamb, both were succulent and tender, cooked to perfection. Sebastian at the bar was a treat. A real craftsman at making a martini. Finally, the ‘83 Margaux was phenomenal. We will definitely be back. A hidden gem of a restaurant with extraordinary service and top-notch food.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Phenomenal ambience, the service was outstanding and so attentive to your every need. The food - wow! Starting with lobster risotto; it was deliciously creamy with the pops of perfectly cooked lobster and al dente zucchini. The herb sauce around infiltrated the dish perfectly and not overwhelming at all. 2nd - branzini with French lentils and fried green tomatoes. My only hope was that there was more. It was the best dish I’ve ever had, fish was so flavorful and crispy skin that melted in your mouth as you ate it, the balls of fried green tomatoes had a savory but sweetness to the end and the lentils were delicious. 3rd - Horse radish encrusted salmon; this dish I finished because it was good - was searching for the aha moment though the whole time. Didn’t really taste the horseradish; The mustard sauce was delicious but I think overpowered the whole dish. 4th - the cheese selection, I loved the presentation of rolling out a cart to let you pick your top 4; genius. 5 - Hazelnut Mille-Feuille,  it was light and tasty, perfect ending. Finally a dish where you can actually taste the hazelnut- it was the star and I loved it! Overall, highly recommend this restaurant; everyone that works there puts forth their best and you can tell. It ran so organized; I was even escorted to the bathroom! Their attentiveness and non stuffy demeanor was refreshing in this kind of environment.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Another fabulous night at Gary Danko!  This is the place to go to celebrate something special.   The resaurant is beautiful: beautiful flowers; beautiful art; beautiful table settings; and well spaced tables, never making you feel crowded together. The food is amazing: you choose 3, 4, or 5 courses with several selections in each couse category (we selected 3 courses but started with Golden Osetra Caviar, which has an extra charge, but is well worth it); there was 5 in our party and each of us raved about our individual selections; everything is made with the freshest ingredients; and the food is beautifully plated with just the right size serving.  The bar and bartender are terrific and the wine list is extensive with a sommelier that is simply, ""the best.""

The service is impeccable, tremendous care without being fussy. If there's one complaint is that the restaurant is small and it looks like there's sometimes a traffic jam, yet everything flows calmly and efficiently, so it's not really a complaint more of an observation. The food was delicious. A good mix of creativity and solid classics deftly executed. A great place to go with friends and family, a business dinner, or something more romantic.

Gary Danko,I had heard great things about this restaurant but then read the lost their Michelin star which concerned me. After eating there I understand why. My friend and I went and shared our selections so we had lots to taste. The Lobster risotto was mushy and the lobster was well hidden. The horseradish crusted salmon was very good. Well cooked and the mustard sauce was a great compliment. The duck was well prepared and very tasty although they were stingy with the figs. Finally the fillet of beef was well cooked but bland. No flavor!  We added salt and pepper so there you go. The chocolate soufflé was raw in the middle. After they poured the sauce in the middle it was literally like a soup. Super disappointed. None of the wait staff even seemed to notice we weren’t finishing our selections. So maybe it was just an off night but I can’t recommend this to anyone.Read more,Overall3
Gary Danko,It was a really nice experience and we prefer the seafood than meat dishes. Really recommend the lobster risotto and scallops. Their service was pretty good and professional. Just be careful the portion are really big. We was too full for 4-course meal.,Overall5

Gary Danko,"My wife and I have dined at GD many times over a period of some 30 years. Only once were we disappointed, and that came shortly after the covid epidemic. They were likely understaffed then or dealing with undertrained individuals.

Last night was different. We made wise choices from the menu and chose good, if hardly outstanding, wine. Overall it was a superb experience. The selection of dishes were at a par with restaurants in France, truly outstanding. There were a lot of waiters dashing around not all with a clear purpose. Nonetheless, GD remains, in our view, the finest restaurant in San Francisco  a  bit old fashioned perhaps, which is exactly what pleases us about it,Read more",Overall5

Then there’s the food. It was incredible. The soup had a depth that was amazing. We also had the scallops which were immaculate. The beef filet was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.

Gary Danko,"Gary Danko, celebrating its 25th year, maintains its high standards for food, service and ambience. the ability to choose each course for a 3,4 or 5 course tasting menu is a wonderful option. I always learn from the cheese course which is a hallmark of the restaurant from its early days. The chocolate soufflé is a must. One nit is that ordering wine by the glass can be a lottery as to what you will be charged. I ordered a Sauterne for the cheese course, which was listed at $18 on the wine list. When I got home, they had charged me $55. Sadly not the first time this has happened. Otherwise, a memorable evening.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Returned after several years with Wife and adult son. Dinner was as good as ever! Started with 2 amuse-bouchés, a corn soup and bilini with salmon and caviar.

Still so amazing that Gary Danko has a reservation agent. All employees were dressed and what I noticed most is that no one was leaving. No one was being rushed to leave and turn around capacity. The food was stellar. I even asked to substitute beef filet for duck and my request was honored without extra charge! Dessert was amazing! Like the terminator, I will be back!Read more",Overall5

While I typically have ordered seafood as my main, I went with the Pork Tenderloin. Sooo good. The next-morning-take-home muffin is such a great final touch to a special evening.",Overall5

Gary Danko,"I like their risotto, lobster and beef dishes.  Oyster with caviar had a strong flavor.  Scallop sweetness was subdued by sweet potatoes with yuzu sauce. Lemon pepper crust around duck breast had a kick compared to the beef.  The best was lobster with mashed potatoes and corn.  Best match on the texture combination and excellent cooking skills on lobster.  Desserts is not my strong suites.  In my opinion, GD side, either.  Souffle experience was fun but too much chocolate to my taste.

Compared to my earlier experiences, their room became darker and more modern gallery style.  One of the reason i liked GD was bright dining room and more spacious table arrangements.  Maybe it’s long gone.

It was fun to revisit GD for years.

Excellent service was always same.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,We had the 4 and 5 course tasting menu. The food was a little disappointing.,Overall4
Gary Danko,Everything was excellent. The risotto appetizer was filled with seafood and very creamy. The seared scallops were done to perfection with a very unique Japanese sweet potato and sauce. The salmon medallion was quite large and the sauce again was a superb complement. The cheese table had at least 20 different varieties which made choosing four very difficult. Save room for the baked chocolate soufflé which was so light and tasty. To fully appreciate the experience the wine pairing is a must. The total meal was the best I’ve ever had in the San Francisco area.Read more,Overall5
Gary Danko,"While an EXCELLENT experience, we ordered the 5 course which was too much food.  I wish the server would have “guided” us and explained if the dishes we ordered were going to be too filling.     We were uncomfortably stuffed.    However, this is a minor issue, overall Gary Danko still remains at the top of the culinary food chain.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko was our go to for special occasions. I was worried that losing their Michelin star would affect people’s desire to eat there but based on the crowd I saw Saturday night it looks like business as usual. We opted for the “choose your own” four course meal. The beef tartar was a little salty and the five pieces of lavash weren’t enough to go with the portion of meat, but luckily bread was continuously getting refilled so I was able to eat it with the tartar. The lobster risotto was as good as I remembered and the portion was very generous. The duck was cooked well but the hash was too salty and I wish they gave more poached cherries to balance the saltiness. Dessert was chocolate soufflé and it was decadent and delicious. At the end of the meal they also brought out a tray of mini desserts and a pineapple cake for each of us to take home. For wine, I’m no longer a heavy drinker so I opted to have two glasses of wine and the first was a very generous pour. I definitely would go back.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,This Relais& Chateau  restaurant Gary Danko is a rare jewel among the high level Californian gastronomy because it doesn’t follow the trend of an infusion  cuisine but remains based on the craftsmanship of real natural cooking. A good example is the stuffed quail. They have a tasting menu but to our delight also an à la carte menue with a wide and exclusive selection of exquisite dishes not to forget their excellent cheese selection rarely found in the US.The wine list is outstanding especially the rarely found Peter Michael Ma belle fille which we of course chose😊!Read more,Overall5
Gary Danko,Quick and friendly service - but perhaps too quick as we didn’t feel relaxed enough. The food was good for the non-vegetarian but really not so good for the vegetarian in our party.

Gary Danko,"After years of hearing about this iconic institution in the SF food scene, we finally made it. It was like stepping through a time machine. Gracious, welcoming service, dark moody lighting, a crowd wearing jackets and dresses, and holy smokes, Krug by the glass!Large portions of “Cal” inspired Americana well prepared and presented but nothing you haven’t eaten before if you’re a roving foodie.

It is a minimum of three courses up to five. We chose one three course and one four course. My husband and I ordered different things so we were able to try multiple food choices.

We selected 4 courses and they were all beautifully presented and delicious. We enjoyed steak tartare, lobster salad, branzini, roasted lobster, scallops and a fish curry. Cocktails were superb, too. We were able to share our 4th course so we had a fabulous selection from the cheese cart followed by a delectable chocolate soufflé.  We’ve been here before, and the service, menu and ambience always make this a special dining experience.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko, known for their stellar service, was a disappointment this time around.  Maybe it was just an off night, but having been several times before, this time was the least impressive.  I initially thought things were off, but when the server pointed to the cheese tray and said, ""these three are goat cheeses, here are some blues, these ones are the stinky cheeses.  Which would you like?""  I realized that it was definitely not the magical experience that I'd had in the past, where every cheese had it's own gorgeous description, making me want to try every single one. Such is life. I hope they can return to their usual standards.Read more",Overall3

From the moment you enter until you walk out the door at the end of your meal, you will be treated to a delightful experience with delicious food.  The staff is attentive without being intrusive.  They just want you to enjoy your meal there.

We did 3 courses and everything was unbelievably outstanding and that was not including the amuse bouche.

My mouth is watering just thinking about my dinner last night.

I would say, my only negative, and it wasn’t even with the restaurant was the casual (almost sloppy) attire of some of the guests.  I know it is summer tourist season but come on……..

Can’t wait to go back.Read more",Overall5

As i ‘ve said their portions were very good and the food was great. Service was excellent as well but minus 1 star for the ambience as the place was fully packed and noise level is through the roof. We will go back but for now we will try other michelin star restos in the Bay!Read more,Overall4

Gary Danko,The four of us had the four course tasting menu with wine pairings. The food was delicious and we thought worth the cost. But the wine pairings were not worth the high cost. We expected the sommelier to come out and talk to us about each wine pairing and why they were chosen with each dish. Instead our waiter came out with all of the wines jumbled in his arm and basically just told us the name and walked off. Definitely not worth $110 per person.

My only complaint  is not limited to Danko’s restaurant Where I have been going since it first open, and I discovered his cuisine at the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco, but The light level ￼ in the restaurant is so low you can barely see what you’re eating.

Gary Danko,"My girlfriend and I recently had the pleasure of celebrating her birthday at Gary Danko in San Francisco, and our experience was absolutely unforgettable. From the moment we arrived, we were warmly welcomed, and the atmosphere was inviting and elegant.

The customer service was top-notch. Our server was not only attentive and friendly but also incredibly knowledgeable. She expertly guided us through the menu and wine list, ensuring that we made the perfect choices for our meal. The cocktails were outstanding, particularly the “Lost in Translation,” which I selected. The blend of premium Japanese whiskey in an Old Fashioned setting was a delightful twist.

Gary Danko’s wine collection is phenomenal, truly a highlight of the evening. The great taste in wine showcased by the restaurant certainly stands out and complemented our meal perfectly. Speaking of the meal, the food was divine. From the tri crème brûlée and glazed oyster to the risotto, seared sea scallops, and baked chocolate soufflé, every dish was a masterpiece. Each bite was a delicious treat, crafted to perfection.

A heartfelt thank you to all the staff, especially our server, who went above and beyond by running after us after we had left the restaurant to return my girlfriend’s cellphone, which she had unknowingly dropped. This level of dedication and care is what defines excellent customer service.

We wholeheartedly give Gary Danko in San Francisco a 4.5 out of 5 stars. The amazing staff and exceptional chef made this the best dining experience we’ve ever had.

When we were trying to decide whether to add the wine pairings to our dinner, our waiter suggested that, given the similarities in the dishes we were ordering, we get a premium bottle of wine for the same price as the two pairings. It was a wonderful decision and complemented all the dishes perfectly. We had the glazed oysters, roasted lobster, quail and chocolate soufflé—and loved them all.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko is a jewel box of a restaurant and worthy of the moniker ""special occasion restaurant."" Beautifully designed, resplendent with magnificent floral arrangements, and darkened mirrors that make the dining room appear to be twice its size. The servers were knowledgeable, smooth, and efficient.
My only slight criticism was with the food. The duck confit salad had too many large bones that I almost choked on. The salad would have been better if the duck meat had been shredded and removed from the bone. The roasted lobster was delicious, but the accompanying vegetables had little flavor. The chocolate souffle, on the other hand, was outstanding, as were the sweet treats to end the meal.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"I was pretty disappointed with the experience, the cocktails appeared to be watered down, they brought the wrong wine then charged me for the original, they upsold us on the “cheese course” but it was just a few thin slices of standard “European-style” cheeses you can buy in wf. The biggest red flag was they doubled(!) the bill when bringing the check to sign, hoping I would just sign without double checking. As soon as I noticed the error I showed my wife and the waiter hurried back and took the check without saying a word - he was clearly watching, indicating it’s a trick they try regularly and not a genuine mistake. Overall it felt like a shakedown and not the high-end dining experience I expected, we will not repeat.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,"My favorite restaurant in San Francisco. There are a few comparable or possibly superior spots, but they are quite a bit more expensive: Atelier Crenne, Benu, a few others. But, if you would like great food, great service and warm inviting place. Please try this San Francisco stable of fine dining.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Very elegant and classical French dinner. The food was not bad, two appetizers were amazing, risotto and oyster with caviar. Only flaw is the oyster dish contains flakes of oyster shell which is very painful in the mouth. The scallop main course is good but the sweet potato portion was too huge, which seems to be overpowering the existence of the scallop. The lamb dish was ok, not impressive. Cheese course amazing, huge portion as well. 

Several complains about the service:
1. We both order 4-course tasting menu and asked for a dessert come together with the cheese course and the other two dessert to be served later. However, all the desserts are served at once alongside the cheese, so I had to stop eating cheese and to save the ice creams from melting. TOOOO overwhelming.
2. After the desserts, there was a really long gap for at least thirty minutes before someone came to talk to us. He asked if anything more could be offered, but I know there is more petit fours coming up so I said if there is anything more coming up. The waiting is a little bit too long. 

Good thing about the service:
1. A huge thanks to the maitre d' for arranging us a romantic corner table. 
2. Everyone was polite and gentle.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,It's a great experience with amazing service.  It's a more traditional menu so not the best for the trendy types.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"The food and the service elevates Gary Danko into a truly fine dining experience. It is disappointing to see people come to a restaurant like Gary Danko in their tshirt and crocs, and stunning to see children eating in the restaurant. Really if you grow up eating at restaraunts like Gary Danko what do you aspire to? Of the dishes we had I highly recommend: the goat cheese tart, fillet of beef, cheese course and pavlova. Was absoltuely outstanding. Also delightful to do the wine pairing with dinner.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,Always one of our favorite places to go for a special celebration. Amazing good. Somewhat simple yet full of taste and flavor. Service is awesome though they seemed a bit rushed (relatively) last night. I love their flexible approach to the menu where you pick how many courses you want and choose between all their dishes. Expensive - especially if you get the wine pairing which was impeccable-but worth it.Read more,Overall5

Gary Danko,"Gary Danko continues to deserve its reputation. From the moment you arrive, they make you feel welcome and special. The dining rooms seem tight when you enter, but when you sit, it feels intimate not crowded. We were immediately approached with a water choice and an offer to order other beverages as well. The menus are brought quickly with an explanation of how it all works. Fixed prix fixe or a choice to build your own from a wide variety of interesting choices. We both chose to build our own four course meals. My choices - lobster salad with avocado (the claw may have been a tad overcooked for my liking) but it was delicious. Next up a salmon medallion with a horseradish mustard sauce - it was excellent, and my pork tenderloin was cooked to perfection. My dining companion had seared ahi tuna, branzini, and scallops. All were perfect.  The courses are sizable enough to leave us satisfied but not bloated.  We both finished with the cheese course. The cheese guy was knowledgable and led us both in the right direction. It was truly a magical evening. We were celebrating an anniversary, and they acknowledged it with a special dessert (this is where the bloated feeling surfaced! :)   )  The only complaints: I felt they were trying to rush our orders as someone came to the table every two minutes or so to ask us if we were ready - I'm sure it was meant to be attentive service, and some would probably complain if they didn't do it. It's just a pet peeve of mine as I enjoy more leisurely dining. Finally, the wine pairing is far too expensive for what it is - of course, this is true of EVERY restaurant, isn't it? We were celebrating and I was lazy so I went for it. The wine choices were great, but the pours were minimal for the money. Small issues for a great evening. Just remember, this is a splurge evening unless you're a venture capitalist or tech bro!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"The food is exceptional in terms of quality, preparation, and presentation. Service is excellent. We have dined at Gary Danko many times over the past 20 +/- years and continue to go back. My only complaint, and this was the first time, there was a very large party at the bar that lingered for 20 minutes before going to their table so it was very noisy, not conducive to an elegant meal. The staff did however recognize this and gave us champagne and an appetizer complimentary. Be prepared to spend as much as one would at any restaurant but it is worth it.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"The food is not bad but considering this is a Michelin restaurant, and I have personally been to ~20 Michelin in Europe, Asia and North America, I would say the food quality and innovation here is lacking compared to its peers. 

We order these dishes: 
1) Panko Breaded Egg with Avocado Mousse and Salsa, Panisse Croutons, and Frisee. This has quite an average taste that you could expect in a normal restaurant.

2) Warm Vegetable Goat Cheese Tart. This is actually my favorite dish out of all but the salad on the side feels like it has no value added to the whole dish and it is just a filling component. 

3) Branzini with Fennel Purée. I can tell the chef is trying to add lots of flavors to make it more special but the combo of all ingredients does not give you a wow moment. 

4) Roast lobsters. The lobster is well cooked and tender but again this is a dish that lacks anything special compared to other Michelins. 

4) Pork main dish. I like how crispy the pork belly is. Even though the sauce is not outstanding I still overall like this one. 

5) Lobster risotto.  This is highly recommended by other reviewers but if you always eat Italian food in Italy, I would say it is just slightly above average but not the best I ever tried. 

We also ordered quail main dish and several deserts but overall just not anything makes me want to return. 

Besides that, the service feels very rushed and the server brought several dish out at once without offering a plate for each person to share. Some of the knives were not clean so they had to switch them for us.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"We were the loud people having too good a time in this staid, quiet resto. It’s from another time but lost its edge so now it’s still amazing food but gathering layer of dust as a relic. That said- the food is still outstanding and the cheese cart is just as epic as memory served. Whoever is on the pastry line is 🔥 and the wines were fantastic. It’s fabulous, just a bit of a throwback.
The bread was odd. Too thinly sliced, texture was a bit aged, was it sourdough? The amuse was poorly timed with menus freshly dropped, I didn’t know what to do or where to put the menu? Timing overall was a bit intense. Picky details but at $350/head, I’ll be picky.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"The food was very good, as usual, but 1 filet ordered medium was served well done. The timing of  courses was strange in that although both diners ordered 5 items plus wine tasting, 1 diner received the 3rd course while the other diner was given nothing- . Both diners received filet course next - following this, a cheese course was served to the diner previously left waiting, and the other was left sitting ( with no wine, even when we asked ) The 5th course ( chocolate souffle) was served simultaneously, however the waiter kept spooning creme Anglaise on top despite being told 3 times the diner did not care for creme Anglais.  The other diner graciously took that dessert. The wine tasting pours were very small ( 2 oz ?) and not exceptional. The service at the end was very inattentive, after 10 minutes of waving a credit card we finally got our check. There was no shortage of staff. We found this to be an unusual experience as in the past we had great service, generous pours of exceptional wines .Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"GTy Danko has been around a long time and therefore is a bit dated especially in their cuisine.

Gary Danko,"We absolutely love this San Francisco staple and go on an annual basis for a celebration. We have dined at this beautiful establishment since it’s opening. With that said we’ve seen a lot of changes and also not seen any. Would be great to see a menu change, and there was a time that this establishment was so well known for such an amazing cheese cart. They had amazing cheeses, the wait staff would describe them in detail, it was served with grapes, toasted bread, honey, and the works. Now, you get a few pieces of very thin bread, a few grapes and nobody really explains the cheeses. They just get wheeled up and you make a choice. A little sad to see that go as that was one of the things that continued to draw us there. It has been that way for some, but we continue our patronage because it holds a lot of sentimental value for us. It would be wonderful to see some new menu items on their menu. That said, whatever you choose will be amazing.  The ambience is wonderful as is the staff.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Superb dinner and ever better service. We were celebrating our 21st anniversary and ordered 4 courses each. Being able to choose your own courses is one of the best features here. It's more fun to choose 8 different dishes. I also ordered the wine pairing.

The amuse bouche was a soup with red bell peppers. I am allergic to peppers, so they brought me the sunchoke soup instead. We had the lobster risotto and glazed oysters with Osetra caviar paired with a Muscadet for our apps. Seared scallops and roasted lobster for our seafood course with Crossbar chardonnay. Filet of beef and lemon pepper duck breast for our meat course. I ordered the duck medium-rare, and it came out well-done. I sent the duck back, and the sommelier topped up my glass of Hirsh pinot noir during the wait. He also brought me a glass of Marsannay burgundy. Very kind gesture. They brought out a new plate of duck, and it was perfect.

The grand finale was their chocolate souffle with 2 sauces (This is non-negotiable; we ALWAYS get this dessert!), and Baked Alaska served with a Sauternes and a Tokaj. AND a beautiful slice of chocolate cake with Happy Anniversary written on the plate. Followed by a tray of lovely mignardises. They also send you home with pineapple muffins for breakfast.

**One recommendation for here and other fine dining places is to skip the napkin-folding when a guest leaves the table. Although it's meant to be thoughtful, we don't want someone touching our napkins in the age of COVID. And it's risky for wait staff to continually touch items that have touched the mouths of other people. We just started dining out again and want to feel as comfortable as possible.

Altogether it was a fantastic dinner. Do not skip the wine pairing. Very generous in comparison to other restaurants of this calibre. We look forward to our next meal here.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"My dinner was excellent--I had lobster salad, delicious, seafood risotto, delicious, 
roasted lobster main course very tasty. I think they should have used fish stock in the sauce of the roasted lobster. I think they used chicken stock maybe also in the risotto.
My partner got the butternut squash soup which was ordinary, the risotto, and the 
lamb plate which was tasty. He thought it was not as good as it should have been.
Our third guest liked everything. The martinis were good. the Service was friendly and attentive. The ambience was good but noisy.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"I love this place. Food is perfect. Service is perfect. This latest trip was perfect. Only negative is that the table you are sat at makes a huge difference. There are amazing tables which are spaced apart and spacious, and then there are tables where you are right in the middle of the conversations of the table next to you. Our dinner for 5 was over $1200, and was worth every penny, but we had one of the “good” tables.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We’ve been coming to Gary Danko for our anniversaries for many years. The food is well prepared, tasty (we always get the seafood risotto, Thai seafood, pork tenderloin, beef filet) and you never leave hungry whether you’re getting the 3, 4, or 5 course meal. The price has gone up since the pandemic but is still affordable for what you get. The bite sized dessert sampler at the end of the meal is a nice touch along with the cake to go. The only disappointment was that they didn’t acknowledge our anniversary this year by giving us a little cake (which used to be customary and made us feel special), especially given the price increase.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"This was our second visit to Gary Danko and we think it surpassed even our first wonderful experience at this restaurant. Not only does Gary Danko offer a genuinely fine dining experience with professional wait staff, the ambience is sophisticated and the food exquisite.

We highly recommend Gary Danko and we will definitely return next time we are in San Francisco.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Always a lovely experience. We’ve dined here numerous times; last night seemed a bit frenetic.

So lucky to have this gem in our neighborhood.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"As always dining at GD’s is a very fine experience. Had a cocktail that wasn’t quite right , but didn’t want to make a fuss as my guest was picking up the bill.  The caviar was amazing, lamb cooked to perfection and dessert over the top delicious—almost too much to eat after such a filling meal.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"It was very nice- not at the level of service was not as I had remembered
For example the last wine pairing was not good- not a single one of the 5 of us drank it and they did not ask? Also very limited descriptions on wine and food- as if in a hurry",Overall4
Gary Danko,Do not miss the opportunity to enjoy this place. The tasting menu was excellent (mix and match any requests from the tasting options) and the wine list impressive. Service was wonderful and it was a meal I will remember!,Overall5
Gary Danko,"We have had wonderful experiences at Gary Danko in the past. That is why we chose this restaurant for my husband's birthday. I love the concept of choosing your tasting menu. The food is excellent and beautifully presented. My problem was our seating situation. We were seated in the middle of a small dining room. It was like having a delicious meal in the middle of a highway. It was loud, very busy and the wait staff dashed around us but generally ignored us. Very unpleasant. We probably won't go there again.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"One of my favorite special occasion restaurants in SF. I've dined here several times over the past 15 years. The vibe is old school not IG trendy. It's not food as art, minimal foam and smears, there isn't a large amount of negative space in proportion to the food on the plate, and you won't leave hungry. I appreciate that you can structure your 3, 4 or 5 courses however you want and that you aren't restricted to a set tasting menu. The service is attentive and excellent. Most recently I had a Saturday at 6:30 pm reservation (that we were actually a bit late for) and we did not feel rushed. The room to the left as you enter where we sat had a reasonable noise level, however I could hear some folks in the room to the right so it may have been louder over there. Favorite dishes were the scallops, oysters, tuna (not crusted), risotto, duck and of course the cheese cart. The espresso martini really is one of the best in SF and the breakfast muffin for the next day is quite yummy. I shall return.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We had a WONDERFUL evening at Gary Danko! The level of service is AMAZING!  I found the level of care and responsive similar to the best dinner I've had which was in NYC at Per Se.  It makes the evening so special to have this level of professionalism by every member of the staff at Gary Danko.  It was a Monday night and the 25 year old restaurant was packed.  This was my first time there and I have always wanted to go there and I was not disappointed! Took my boyfriend for his birthday and we had the 5 course tasting menu with accompanying wine pairing.  Everything was so delicious and abundant, not one of those tasting menus that has you going home starving :)   Everything was so professional, for example, one of the wines wasn't to our liking and the sommelier quickly and seamlessly provided us a second choice that we loved.  The staff provided lovely and delicious dessert with a candle which was such a nice touch and allowed me a great picture opportunity and to sing a quiet happy birthday to him.  Such a warm, welcoming and perfect evening! We will be back very soon.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Disappointing for a Michelin Star restaurant. Good selection of dishes & wines, but felt rushed to order, cooked appetizers & mains were lukewarm (at best) and bread was unusually average for a restaurant of this caliber. On the positive side, ambience is lovely, the cheeseboard options were extensive & all the desserts were wonderful. Overall, expected better.",Overall3

Gary Danko,"Haven’t been in the space since it was Chez Michel. One of the better dining rooms in the City. Charming, comfortable and actually quiet enough so you could hear the dinner conversation.
Service and all the staff are absolutely impeccable. Attentive, courteous, friendly and accommodating. That’s a lost art with 99% of restaurants.
Price point is very reasonable. Corkage is $100 but the wine service and stemware make it worth that.
Food gets an A-. Lots of choices and portions are spot on.
Already lining up a return date with the family.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Hostess was polite on greeting, pleasant in letting me know where the restrooms were and opening the door for us when we exited. Service was excellent, attentive and efficient on getting everything moving smoothly. 

The note of the reason on why we are celebrating and dining, was clearly made special. Congratulations were said and complimentary sweets were offered. It made the dining experience memorable surely.

I like how there’s flexibility of choosing the courses from all dishes on the menu and just not limited to one from each appetizer, entree and dessert. Food was great and solid. I adore the amuse bouche, roasted lobster and chocolate soufflé were the highlights for me.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"For a restaurant of this caliber and the name that goes with,’Gary Danko’. I would expect much better food than what I got last night. While the appetizers were out of this world! My entree, which was lamb, was the WORST LAMB I have EVER eaten in a restaurant! It didn’t have ANY taste! At first I thought it was beef!! It did not have the usual lamb (a little gamey) after taste!!
I was brought up eating lamb so I know lamb when I eat it!! They did take it back and I ordered the pork, which was not very good either!! You would think a restaurant like this would have done a ‘Taste Test’ 2 C if their foods R any good or not! 😟Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"We’ve been coming here for about 20 years and always like to celebrate special occasions like birthdays.  I like that you can select anything on the menu to be your starter or which course of your meal.  Servers are very attentive here which unfortunately is rare these days at most other places. Little niceties like the complementary amuse bouche while you examine the menu, surprise dessert for the birthday celebrant, and the take home individual breakfast cake all add to the value and satisfaction of dining here. I hope Gary Danko restaurant will still be here and having all these great qualities for the next 20 years!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,Gary Danko did not dissappoint us again!  We were hosting our relatives from Japan and reserved the private dining room.

We drove about an hour to get there and it was surprisingly smooth (reservations were at 845pm, so that probably had something to do with it).  There are two parking garages nearby, both about a block and a half from the restaurant.  We parked at the ￼one located at 655 Beach St (vs Ghirardelli).  Be prepared to walk one block up hill.

The service was impeccable and the food was splendid.  We opted for the 5 course option and every item was a star.  My husband especially loved the lobster risotto and my favorite was the lobster over potato purée.  The drinks were also well balanced.

It was the perfect date night spots and one of the best dining experiences of my life. We will definitely return!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We love Gary Danko for special occasions and they did not disappoint for my husband’s birthday. He had the Lobster Risotto which was incredible, I had the Warm Vegetable Tart which was good, but it didn’t wow. Next came the Scallops with Carrot Top Pesto. Perfectly done, lovely flavors.  Next he had the Filet of Beef (melt in your mouth beefiness combined with great sides) and I had the Shellfish Thai Curry. The curry was bland,even flavorless, I expected some spice but the shellfish overwhelmed the sauce. It was not my favorite dish. We then had the cheese course (one of our favorite courses, who does cheese carts anymore outside of Europe?). Last, but not least, he had the Louisiana Butter Cake and I had the Baked Alaska. Both were out of this world. As always the service was exceptional as was the ambience. We will be back!Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,Not the Quality and Wow as in the past.  My wife and I have eaten at Gary Danko's at least 8 times now.  We felt rushed during our meal and the bill was laid on our table when our coffee arrived.  Unfortunately the food is not the same:-(,Overall3

Gary Danko,"Yikes. I really don’t know where to start but I guess the general takeaway will do— uninspired, bland, and in some cases cafeteria quality food. Chaotic service (but totally nice people!). Fine for a $50 meal for two. Absolutely outrageous for a $500 meal for two, and I don’t mind spending $500 on a memorable dining experience.

Gary Danko,"The first time we dined at Gary Danko was a magical experience. Service was attentive and informed, food was executed perfectly, and the restaurant’s pleasant ambience left us waiting for a special occasion to return.

This visit was the complete opposite. From the moment we sat down we felt rushed, as if service was looking to turn over the table as fast as possible. The general ambience was much more boisterous and casual than before. While we were still settling in, the amuse bouche was presented (“if you could tip your menus off the plate”). Two different servers visited within five minutes to ask us if we were ready to order. We placed our orders and decided to leave after two (of our planned five) courses. The beef tartare was overly creamy, lacking a balance of acid and freshness. The two small scallops had a pedestrian sear and were over-salted. The accompanying carrot top pesto was not assertive enough to stand up to the sweetness of the carrots and candied pepitas.

Every diner’s taste is different and the busy restaurant proves that GD remains popular as ever. However, we felt that to continue at this price point would not be prudent and a disservice to the memory of our first visit. There are plenty of Michelin restaurants in San Francisco and this was not up to par—maybe an off night, but disappointing nonetheless.

The manager comped a round of drinks as a gesture of goodwill, which we appreciated, but I do not expect we will be returning.Read more",Overall1

At all moments during each visit the staff was friendly and tuned in to our mood and personal social style. They were intuitive to our interest in either privacy or attention, and gracious and well informed about all that they were serving. Each table was addressed as a special guest. The resulting atmosphere was really wonderful to be in. They create a dining experience that I want to be in again.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"My husband and I went to Gary Danko's to celebrate my birthday. My husband has been there a handful of times, but it was a first for me. I have heard wonderful things about the restaurant and was very much looking forward to it. I have been to many other Michelin star restaurants so had an idea of what to expect. I would have to say, overall, it was nice, but I would not say it was excellent. 

First of all, my first disappointment was with the bread. I was quite surprised the bread was thin and flat, but most of all, it wasn't even warm. There was nothing special about it. We live in SF, where we are known for our incredible sourdough bread. So it was really disappointing that a 1 Michelin star restaurant didn't serve an amazing slice of bread or maybe even a popover like they have a Wayfare Tavern. My husband and I ordered the 4 course meal. For the most part, everything was delicious, but what was surprising was that for my steak filet, it came with broccoli florets. The use of broccoli florets seemed like an odd choice and brought the scale of the dish down. I took a photo and showed it to friends and they made the same comment. I think a broccoli rabe or some other vegetable would have elevated it more. Lastly, for dessert, I ordered the chocolate soufflé. The soufflé came with a vanilla bean and dark chocolate sauce. Before I knew what was happening the waiter breaks my soufflé with the fork and starts to pour the vanilla sauce over my dessert. It immediately flattened the soufflé and made it soggy. I had to ask him not to pour the dark chocolate or it would have been too much. I wish he would have asked if he could pour the sauce, because personally, I would have left it alone and made the sauces a dipping sauce so that I could control the amount. 
I'm glad I got to finally experience the infamous, Gary Danko. I think it's nice that they have pre-fixe options & the staff was great. The food overall, was good, but definitely not an out of the park experience.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Honestly, we were expecting much more for a one star Michelin restaurant. Of the things that did not work for us, service seemed very rushed to us, we had to ask for Brad and when we got bread, we did not even get butter. Honestly charging $100 for corkage seems a bit excessive as well. We went ahead and paid for it but the Sommelier  did not even come by to pour the wine. Service personnel, or friendly, but can seem very rushed. The table was very closely spaced to others, and we felt cramped. Meals were fine, especially recommend the desserts, but the main courses were on par below for one star restaurant, I would suggest in terms of taste. The presentation was just fine, but we had to add salt and pepper to bring flavoring. To me and my wife Carrie Danko is a solo restaurant but a bit overvalued for the price and we feel based upon our experiences. It is not currently measuring up to one star experience.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,"First of all, I want to thank Gary Danko for their flexibility and understanding.  This dinner was meant to celebrate the retirement of a co-worker I worked with for 30 years.  At 1:30p on the day of our reservation, she had to cancel.  Then getting to the restaurant was brutal, I suspect people going out of town for Martin Luther King weekend, but we were 15 mins late.  The staff had no problem with either issue.  Gary Danko is my favorite restaurant in the City and my go-to for special dinners.  We love doing the wine pairing as the wines go so well with the course and often I taste wines I would never have selected.  For my main course, I could not decide between the salmon and scallops.  Our waiter said the scallops were to die for, and he was 100% correct.  I also love the service.  You lose count on the number of people who come to the table.  I cannot wait until our next dining experience at Gary Danko.Read more",Overall5

The sommelier made a few big mistakes. He served a sweeter Riesling with one of the first dishes that was a missed match. He also brought me the wrong dish once. Other than that, we loved the food. If I ever went back, I would question the wine pairings more closely because this sommelier was wrong on a few, including bringing the wrong dessert wine to my guest.Read more",Overall4

The food was really amazing, the presentation, the style, the staff were very attentive and elegant. It's not inexpensive but it's worth it.

Gary Danko,"My expectations were very high based on the restaruants reputation. We were greeted warmly when we came in and were seated at a very nice table. After that point, there were plenty of attendants, but we felt like it was a race to get us to put in our dinner order. We wanted to sit down and enjoy a cocktail but had to ask them to hold off putting in the dinner order very soon after we just sat down. Corkage fee was $100, which is one of the highest I have seen and we did not open the bottle of wine we brought. We chose the 3 course option. The first course, risotto with lobster, etc. was very good, the fillet of beef second course was good, and the last dessert course, chocolate souffle' was good,  but one order (the third course of a 3 course dinner) was served 15 minutes after everyone else. We were not asked if we wanted coffee or tea, which we finally ordered and received after the first two deserts were served and arrived awhile later.  I think everyone thought the food was good, the restaurant beautiful and the food presented well, but I do not believe this restaurant currently meets the acclaims it has received at this time for the price being offered. We dine out 2 to 3 times a week, have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and my sibling trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. We are not new dining at fine restaurants. It may have just been an off night at our table.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"I visited Gary Danko with high expectations, lured by its reputation as a Michelin-starred establishment in the heart of San Francisco. However, my experience was far from the culinary journey I anticipated, instead spiraling into a tale of disappointment and missed opportunities.

The first setback was the ambience. For a restaurant with a four-dollar-sign rating, one would expect a setting of elegance and tranquility. Instead, I was greeted by a cacophony of noise, resonating within a room crammed with diners and decked with outdated furniture. The cramped space left little room for privacy or comfort, a stark contrast to the exclusive dining experience I had envisioned.

Moving on to the cuisine, the menu was a mixed bag. While the Brandino and fillet were passable, they were mere glimmers in an otherwise unremarkable culinary landscape. The rest of the dishes lacked the vibrancy and innovation I eagerly anticipated. It was a culinary journey devoid of excitement or creativity, with flavors that were bland and uninspiring. This was a surprising misstep for a restaurant boasting a Michelin star.

The service compounded my disappointment. The staff, who should be ambassadors of the restaurant's ethos, seemed utterly disinterested. A Michelin-starred restaurant is expected to offer not just food, but an educational and engaging experience about its menu's origins, flavors, and textures. However, the staff here lacked both leadership and enthusiasm, turning what should have been a captivating narrative into a tedious recitation.

The presentation of the dishes was merely adequate, doing little to uplift the overall lackluster experience. It felt like a circus without charm, a rote performance lacking in heart and engagement.

In summary, my visit to Gary Danko was far from the memorable experience I had hoped for. It was an encounter that barely skimmed the surface of what could be termed an 'experience.’ Danko Nein DankeRead more",Overall2
Gary Danko,"Native San Franciscans, attended for a special occasion never been before. Food was average and almost too much attention because nonstop interruptions, even when my husband was making a toa￼st it was interrupted by bread being almost dropped in our wine glass. Food was served so fast we finished 4 courses in less than an hour. Felt rushed and too attentive.",Overall3
Gary Danko,Nice ambience to spend a night out with a loved one. Really enjoyed the dinner,Overall5
Gary Danko,"Knowing its a Michelin Star resturant, you come in expecting good food, and service.  Expecting this, we were still very excited on our entire expericance.

Yes the food was amazing.  this is expected at this price point. But be warned, when you eat the lobster rosota, you will cry when you plate is empty.  Just be preparied, its going to happen.

But what stood out most to me was the service.  There was an Army of people catering to everyone.  Which meant water never got to half full, and even the bread was refilled through the meal.  That was great. 

Some of those untangible things that effect your dinner was the fact that the ""army"" always had a smile on thier face.  No grumpy, or your bothering me looks here.  Just people happy to serve with a smile.  It was noticed and appreciated.

Special not to Rhonda, you are just AMAZING, and you made my folks night very special!!!!!!!

Gary Danko,"This is our second time here.  This is a very elegant restaurant with a beautiful ambience.  All of the staff is quite friendly and attentive.  My husband ordered the Chef’s Tasting Menu.   He was quite pleased with every course as well as the wine pairing that accompanied the menu.  With such a high caliber restaurant- and being quite picky- it would have been nice if the bread was warm and the butter was at least soft enough to spread on the bread.  The bread itself was delicious.  I ordered my own courses and the sommelier chose a pairing for me based upon my choices.  Every course was amazing- especially the roasted lobster with the heavenly potato purée and the scallops- so lovely!!   I love dessert and I made a huge mistake by not ordering the chocolate soufflé, like my very happy husband!  I ordered the butter cake and was quite disappointed to be honest.  Mastro’s has the upper hand on this butter cake.  Overall though- a very lovely dinner in a beautiful setting.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko is our favorite SF restaurant and we always try to go for our special occasions. The quality of the food and the flexibility with the 3/4/5 course options is ideal for all.

We went with another couple to celebrate my wife's birthday and our friend's promotion. We ordered a wide variety: cheese, lobster, lobster risotto, the two different tuna dishes, beef filet, and chocolate soufflé. All were just as good this time as we always remember it being.

Gary Danko,"I was looking forward to having dinner here. It had been a long time since I’ve enjoyed a highly rated restaurant like the experiences I’ve had in the past at Aqua, Kokkari, Farrallon, Boulevard and Postrio. Farallon was one of the most unforgettable experiences that I remember because the servers were incredible, engaging, excited about the menu. I was hoping Gary Danko would be similar. The serving staff just seemed disinterested. If your serving something unparalleled to anything else, the staff’s responsibility is to embrace their unique knowledge and educate the customer on the menu because the expectation is your menu is that extraordinary that you have to explain it. They should have been excited about talking about origin, flavors and textures. Nobody was excited about talking about the menu at all. Service almost felt circus-like. The risotto and the scallops were delicious. The filet of beef was bland. Presentation was ok. The smoke presentation at International Smokehouse was better relative to the reputation of the restaurants. I would have to say the experience was lackluster and I would barely call it an experience. Maybe 10-15 years ago the experience would’ve been better having more competitors. Sadly, I was a little disappointed and I hate to admit that.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"I went with high expectations but it turned a just ok experience.
The host was very nice and friendly and sat us in a very small table between two 4 pp table that we needed to be very careful to not drop anything from the other tables. When they dropped the menus they explained very quickly how they do but I couldn’t hear the server ( to be honest I don’t know if he was a server) and I wanted a better explanation but two of their team came already asking: “you ready to order?” I said no and I would like to understand the menu and how would work the wine paring but the guy didn’t know how to explain it, until a woman came (I believe the sommelier and helped us). After drinks taken again serves would came with:”are you ready to order?” For a Michelin star restaurant “are you ready to order” shouldn’t exist and yes “May I help with any questions”.
Another server came and took our order I asked the pork disk cooked through because she mention that would came pink and she said it was fine cook more. When the dish came it was pink, needed to waive to someone look to us  to send it back. During our entire dinner no one came to us ask if we were good or if we want more drinks my partner didn’t eat most part of her pork dish and no one notice or asked anything. Everything was served so fast that in our main course (we got a tasting of 4) we were there for just one hour. I believe when you are paying nearly $600 two people for a dinner you want not just the food but the experience from the restaurant and it was something I didn’t have a bit disappointed.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"First time at Gary Danko's restaurant.  Everything was exceptional but paying 3 x for wine compared to retail is nuts.  Been to many restaurants (Michelin included) in my time and found 2x is norm but 3x...I find that gouging!

Next, most restaurants explain each dish when presenting you with the plate.  They did not.  They just delivered the food that was ordered.

We did three courses with wine pairing.  My partner had the duck and I had the salmon and neither wine pairing worked.  Cheese course was nondescript and our chocolate soufflé was mushy.

Gary Danko,"I'm not sure if the standard for a Michelin star restaurant is different in the USA, but having eaten in a number of Michelin starred restaurants through UK and Europe, the standard of the food served at Gary Dando sadly didn't even come close. We can get better food, including quality of ingredients, culinary skill and presentation in 5 star restaurants in the UK. Very disappointing.
While the decor of the restaurant was pleasant, the excessive number of middle aged male waiters dressed in business suits was something to behold! Yet despite the number of these 'business men' floating around, I still had to ask for someone to kindly remove the wine list from our table and take our wine order whilst we had almost finished our starter course. This restaurant may at one time have deserved its Michelin star but it certainly doesn't now.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,"This was our third visit to Gary Danko and the food was five-star, as always.  And I offer three observations:

First, the restaurant has allowed the level of attire to decline.  We saw one guest wearing a baseball cap through dinner.  Another was wearing a tee-shirt.  And another was wearing sneakers.  I wore a sports coat and dress slacks, which I believe to be the minimum that should be required.

Second, the noise level of the restaurant has increased since our last visit.  We found this distracti-ng during dinner and something that management should remedy.

Lastly, service was efficient to the point of being rushed.  After seating, we were ambushed by the person delivering the menus, another asking about water and yet another asking about cocktails.  During dinner I had to ask our waiter twice to slow down between courses.

The food quality was exceptional, but  management should address the points noted.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Our experience was spot on. The service and the food was amazing. The only flaw in my opinion was the bison I selected from the tasting menu, but other than that everything was flawless. One of the highlights for me was the farm Egg “Benedict” with Duck Confit, Avocado, Tobiko, and Hollandaise. I say this because I am particularly fond of eggs Benedict in general and I really love a good poached egg and hollandaise. This was by far the BEST poached egg and hollandaise I have ever experienced anywhere. It sounds simple, but it's really not.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"In our recent trip to San Francisco, we stayed for a week and ate at many of the highest rated restaurants in the city, but Gary Danko was the best. The food was top notch, the service excellent. We have younger kids, and while they're very experienced restaurant-ers and very well behaved, you can sometimes tell that restaurants are a bit hesitant to accept them. At Gary Danko's we were accepted with open arms and we all felt very welcomed. Would give it 6/5 if I could.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"The food and service were phenomenal!  This was our fifth experience at this amazing restaurant. Never a disappointment. We’ve always done the 4 course option and shared tastes with one another. We probably should have opted for the 5 course instead.  My only complaint is that the food is so wonderful, you wanna come back again the very next night!  Alas, that would be a little out of my budget. For the 3 of us, after dinner, alcohol and tip the meal was an easy $1,000.  But . . . Worth every penny for a special occasion!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Located along one of San Francisco's renown cable lines, near Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square, Gary Danko is a nice restaurant with wide variety of food selections, nice ambiance, and capable service team.  The diverse menu is on their website and we found it helpful to preview it in advance.  This visit brought back memories of our prior experience, yea.   Diners at other tables appeared to be enjoying themselves, too.  An earlier reservation allows you more calmness, when the dining room fills up, you feel it.  tiywwt.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,Excellently prepared food. Lots of choices. Wines were great. Service impeccable. It was very noisy due to a party at the bar.,Overall5
Gary Danko,Food was good but for those prices you deserve excellent. Very noisy inside so ambience suffered from that. Service was outstanding. Seafood risotto was so flavorful and with large chunks of shrimp and lobster - the best dish of the night. Benedict egg with duck confit was good but the duck was oddly cut and its flavor did not shine through all the other ingredients. Filet of Beef was perfectly cooked but a bit bland and the whole dish itself was pedestrian. We did not have any wine or cocktails so cannot comment on those but seeing the wine list made us gulp a bit - very pricey. They did bring to the table a tasty amuse bouche and complimentary chocolate raspberry cake for our anniversary - very nice! Add to those some delicious petite fours and a parting gift and the whole experience was a delight.Read more,Overall4

Great date restaurant!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"What a great experience! The staff is superb and really make the evening comfortable. They have an excellent selection of wine, including burgundy which I tend to enjoy. Some of the menu items do have larger portions than what we expected from a Michelin star restaurant, but that isn't a bad thing. We thoroughly enjoyed everything that the restaurant had to offer and I must state again that the staff is very good at what they do and are well seasoned in their attentiveness and full service experience.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"A lovely restaurant for a special occasion. The food was outstanding and absolutely delicious. The service when we arrived was very attentive but did dwindle off slightly throughout the evening for example no-one refilled our wineglasses which I would normally expect in a high end restaurant. Also the wine was not placed in a cooler.
My only criticism would be that the food was served really quickly, literally one course straight after another which made the evening feel a little rushed. I asked that they hold back on serving our dessert and wish I had asked for the same earlier.Read more",Overall4

The lobster risotto, seared beef fillet and scallops were excellent. The crème brûlée and the complimentary pastries from the chef were very good also. The service was simply outstanding- exceptional service that definitely lived up to expectations one has of Gary Danko. The ambiance was good in-spite of a full restaurant for the time we were there- 8:00 PM PST to 10:00 PM PST. Brilliant dinner experience at Gary Danko!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,Amazing dinner and evening.  Very romantic and consistent.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"The good:

Food was excellent. 

Arrived 5 mins early and were promptly seated. Wife and I ordered a drink from the bar to start the meal and enjoyed a caviar dish.  Both ordered the 5 course meal with wine pairing.  All were delicious and well portioned. The wines were paired perfectly and enhanced the food. 

Service was excellent. Staff was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and had good banter while at the table.  Made helpful recommendations

The bad:
No valet parking. 

The ugly:
The bathroom floor was sticky (each step was like peeling Velcro) and the soap dispenser was broken.

Overall a very good experience, but not great because of the state of the bathroom & lack of valet parking.  The parking thing is inconvenient but the bathroom needs to be sorted out asap.  

Still recommend because the food and drinks were Michelin star worthy, and resolving the bathroom issue should happen quicklyRead more",Overall4
Gary Danko,Nice to be able to select your individual courses to create your own tasting menu. It is expensive.,Overall5

Gary Danko,"The courses selections were 3 courses, 4 courses or 5 courses OR the pre-fixed 5 course. What I really liked was the course selections can be choices from appetizers, main courses or deserts. I lean they can be all three from the main course selection or all deserts, doesn’t have to be one of each area. That was very fun.",Overall5

Gary Danko,I made the the reservation based on the fact it is a relais chateaux . The service is very good . Everyone was friendly and very attentive. The way it should be.  The food was ok.  There were things that needed improvement. The bread was cold and tasteless and with the butter was rock hard and also flavorless.  The filet was tender but needed more seasoning and to be hotter. The same with potatoes & broccoli.  The whole meal left me a little disappointed.  I had expected more. My dinner partner thought the same with his meal. The dessert was good. Overall not sure I would come back for the price point.Read more,Overall4
Gary Danko,"Loved the place, food and atmosphere. Very friendly, very welcoming. I do have some reservations about the price-quality ratio. Bit pricey, but I guess that’s California for you…",Overall4
Gary Danko,"The food was excellent, overpriced but very very tasty. My one complaint is that I ordered a glass of Ridge Zinfandel (way overpriced) and it was cold. We have vineyards and a winery in Alexander Valley, and I told the waiter this wine is too cold. He looked at me like I didn’t know what I was doing, he mentioned it to his supervisor and he acted like I was nuts.
Anyway, they should get their stuff together on serving red wine; I should have brought a bottle of our wine but their corkage is $100 a bottle.
We probably won’t go back.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Wow. Where to begin. We were welcomed by two hostesses who looked us in the eye and genuinely seemed to mean it. We were escorted to our table and assisted throughout this dining experience by a number of well tailored and attentive gentlemen and women. No pretense. Just the real thing. The food was excellent and the arrival of each course was timed perfectly. This was a birthday outing for my wife and our first visit to Gary Danko. My wife is very selective about her food and is not shy in expressing an opinion. When I noticed her enjoying each plate presented to her, I knew we'd come to the right place. The lobster is what led me to book our reservation at GD. Pricey? Yes. But under the circumstances a commitment (to my wife and to this dining experience) is either all or nothing. And this one was worth it.Read more",Overall5

I’ve been to some nice restaurants, but this is probably the best one I’ve ever been to. The sommelier did a fantastic wine pairing as well — every single wine was phenomenal.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko only gets better. Aside from the food, we love the fact that their five course tasting menu can be altered to three or four courses with a wide selection of courses in each category:appetizers, fish, entree, cheese and desert. We always get four courses with my husband getting the wonderful cheese selection, followed by me and my sweet tooth. Over the years, we’ve decided to go with the wine pairing - and let the adventure continue. If your taste doesn’t run to the wine they’ve chosen for that course, they are ready with a second selection.  Then there is the service: friendly with out being obsequious. They seem to enjoy you enjoying the restaurant.  We live in Carmel so don’t get up to San Francisco that often - but atleast once a year we are treating ourselves. And as we leave, we are already anticipating the next time!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Excellent service, but my rare steak was dry and rather tasteless.  This was my second visit over a long weekend and the first visit was ok but food was not served hot; just lukewarm.  I thought I would try again, but was terribly disappointed in the quality of the filet mignon.",Overall3
Gary Danko,"Service was terrific. Food was underwhelming as my salmon was bland and the scallops were on the dry side.  The bison was excellent is a rare state with a sear.  Great flavor. However, for the price, I had expected more regarding the food.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Service was flawless. Attentive, non pretentious, and overall seamless. We started with cocktails, which lacked depth (for the price point). The food also lacked depth + quality, and creativity. The ambiance is flawless, it’s just very clearly that this is a corporate-owned restaurant. Overall, this is worth the *experience*.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"First time and we were very impressed overall.  The service was superb, menu selections were excellent, the wine pairings were spot on, and the ambience was lovely.

Gary Danko,"I took my husband out for a surprise dinner this past weekend at Gary Danko - we’ve been collecting michelin stars in SF and I thought that it was important for us to pay our respects to the longest running michelin star in the city. I was also excited for trying something a little more traditional in both food and ambiance.

Upon arrival at our table a host (or some kind of support staff role) - an older gentleman - came by to explain the menu. Even though there were two of us in the booth, he explained the menu only to my husband and kept referring to me as “she” even though I was sitting right there - “…what she orders” It was strange, insulting, and frankly, misogynistic.

Our actual server was more conversant to both of us, and the meal was absolutely fantastic. We ordered 5 courses expecting smaller portions and were surprised by how much food was portioned. The chocolate soufflé was perfection and for savory - the bison and duck were spectacular.

When it came time for the check, it was placed in my husbands hand, which I had to take from him to pay. I understand that the vibe here is old-fashioned, but I left feeling really surprised - like this is still SF, right? I hate to even bring up the money but if I am paying >500$ for a meal I expect to be treated like a person who is present at the table, and not a decoration. This aspect of the service during our experience was absolutely unacceptable.Read more",Overall2

I'd forgotten how beautiful GD is, and the room is very calming. 4 of us at dinner, each ordering different items, all of it delicious. I had 3 courses (app, a fish and dessert) and couldn't eat another bite. The outstanding part was our interaction with the staff, especially the Sommelier, and I'm sorry I didn't get her name. She was so helpful with not only the two (different) bottles of wine we ordered but answered our food questions, too. 

Besides the food, which is outstanding, the staff is friendly, helpful and not stuff/ pompous which I've experienced at similar high-end restaurants. A wonderful evening!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We are not particularly adventurous and Gary Danko gave us a wide choice of elevated courses within our comfort zone. The wait staff made it very clear that 5 Courses mean literally any five selections, presented in any order, from the impressively long list of course offerings. We all started with the Risotto with Lobster (Appetizer), then had the Scallops (Fish), Salmon (a second Fish, instead of a Cheese course after the Meat), Filet of Beef (Meat), and each of the three of us had a different Dessert course. We did not have the wine pairing but had cocktails. There were also a couple of nice surprises at the end of the meal. Everything was beautifully presented and of the quality one would hope to find in a Michelin-star restaurant.Read more",Overall5

The way my dessert was packaged was disappointing as it ruined the entire dessert - presentation or taste.

Gary Danko,"The Michelin Guide says 1 star but this was way better than some of our 3-star experiences. Loved the food, attention to detail, service, overall food options and super tasty cocktails. Our host Cole was excellent. The dessert plate (3 different kind of crème brûlée - chocolate, matcha and passion fruit) was to die for. We will be back to try the rest of the menu for sure!

In detail:

The dining room felt cozy (but looks bigger with mirrors), well-lit and smell of Lillie’s and fresh flowers, which we loved. We didn’t do the wine pairing because both wifey and I are tequila-mezcal enthusiasts so we went for the cocktails.

We both chose the 4-course meal:

Wifey had:
- seared ahi tuna (4/5): needs a bit more flavor
- risotto with lobster (8/5!): AMAZING!!
- roast lobster (5/5) (Amazing! Tarragon!)
- crème brûlée (10/5!!) I’m not a dessert guy but this plate was HEAVENLY!!

And I had:
- lobster salad (5/5) (Mustard tarragon vinaigrette!!! Did I say I love Tarragon?!)
- coconut Thai shellfish curry (7/5) (I can eat this dish for breakfast, lunch and dinner - and for dessert!)
- seared filet of beef (7/5) (OMG I’m a huge steak fan. I don’t know what cut of beef this was but I’m sure it has to be wagyu!)
- Crème Fraiche cheesecake (5/5). I also want to try the cashew cake next. And the cheese cart!Read more",Overall5

I particularly liked the chocolate mouse, the oyster and caviar soup, and the scallops.  The flavors were wonderful, and I often wondered what type of seasonings were added to impart the flavor to the food.

Gary Danko,The tasting menu with the matching wines was fantastic. I never expected 20-year old wines. I particularly liked the beef filet course. I have never had such tender meat.

The answer given was the date the cupcake was made, he said it proudly emphasizing how fresh the cupcake was due to it is always made fresh the same day. BUT we have 4 cupcakes at the table.

Gary Danko,"Heard a lot about this restaurant and it is one of the legendary ones in San Francisco.  The food was excellent. As expected, it is expensive and a splurge. The service is impeccable but I gave it 3 stars for service because I asked for a table by the window and was not given one. As we were seated, 2 window tables opened up, both of which remained open for over an hour, so I am not sure why my request was not granted.  Our table for 2 was in the middle part of the restaurant with lots of traffic going back and forth that did significantly diminish the experience. Overall 4 stars and of course, at least one visit here should be on the San Francisco restaurant bucket list.  Restauranteurs need to be aware of how important seating request are to clients.Read more",Overall4

Also, being able to have a special floral arrangement on the table for when we arrived- absolutely wonderful! Thank you for all that you and your team does!Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"After 20 years this restaurant has not missed a beat. It is an incredible fine dining experience and is consistently outstanding. The only reason I gave food a 4 star is because we received the wrong dish but it was still delicious and we ate it.  You can spend this kind money at other more trendy fine-dining restaurants in SF but Gary Danko remains a gold standard and cannot be beat by newer, less established places. Hands down favorite.Read more",Overall5

We both had a four course meal paired with four wines. It was especially nice as we both could pick and choose any four items off of the menu. Thus we each picked different dishes and had an amazing time sharing each throughout the night. 

The service was superb and atmosphere was very romantic. 

My only criticism is the styling seemed dated and  in need of a revitalization. 

Otherwise I highly recommend!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"A place for a special dinner experience, but maybe & probably past its time.  

The famous owner chef Gary Danko now more or only with an ADMIN role now & x years it seems, NOT there at night or cooking his named food & present at night when they are there & doing their real work, dinners only.  A bad sign & ominous.  When the cat is away, the mice play.  The rumors I hear.

The good & bad...

High quality foods, but some WAY overcooked or very bland tasting.  The famous risotto dish WAY to watery & overcooked.  I am told they cook it during the daytime when not busy & so NOT FRESH for the order.  The desserts bordered on very bland & boring...except the bananas foster made tableside, simple & yummy!

Worse, you give CREDIT CARD with your resy, they also call to confirm before & DEMAND your call back & when I did, the young woman Rep “Amber”, tells me that she works OFF SITE & don’t know Mr. Danko or even the name of the current Head Chefs.  What?  Huh?  That was in a Friday, then Sat I start getting unwanted & unauthorized TEXTS from them wanting or DEMANDING more confirmations!  They take your money upfront upon resy & call 2-3 days before meal with MANDATORY $$$ then, & then keep HOUNDING you?

Moreover, upon entry, the Host tells me that they don’t carefully read the reservation SPECIAL REQUESTS/Comments Section ?  What?  Huh?  The 1st Server then violates one of the comments/requests upon us being seated?  What?  Huh?

Way toooooo many Waiters (they call “Captains” & “Floor Managers”), like a few other way too formal SF eateries.  You get your menu with one, make an order with another, then can’t find either one later.  Way tooooo complex & impersonal!!!  No connection with customer!!!! At least our “bread boy” was consistent...

The wine man, maybe “Jeremy” talked way tooooo much & long, almost destroying the experience & quiet.  Is he on speed?

Last there 20 years ago, I’ll wait 20 more for the next visit..IF it exists by then.  I tried.  I survived.  Next.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Service was canned (for tourists) in its presentation.  They had a lot of people working there but it felt super fake.  We were rushed out after our meal so they could seat the next table.  We weren't camping as we only had 3 courses so we weren't there very long.  We were just enjoying conversation and as soon as we took our last sip of wine 3 different people came up within 3 minutes to ask if we needed anything else.  I asked, are you waiting to seat the table and he said yes.  So we left.  Kind of a bummer overall really.  Food was fantastic though.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"We went in November of 2019 after reading the rave reviews. We could not have been more disappointed. We spent $1200 on dinner for 4 with wine. We bought 2 beautiful bottles of wine, however, one was bad. We  were on our annual wine buying trip to Napa and currently have 400+ bottles in our wine cellar. We are well educated wine drinkers and without a doubt know a bottle of vinegar wine when we taste it. We indicated at the first sip that it was bad and they did not offer to replace it, even after knowing we were spending hundreds of dollars on our other bottle and food courses.  This place is a tourist trap, there were 2 courses of the 15 course between us that were worthy of a high-end restaurant. The staff was uneducated and the sommelier was the worst I have ever encountered at any restaurant ever.

Gary Danko,I've been to GDs several times and the service is still top. The food was delicious except for the seared ahi. I also caution people that Danko's is completely heartless when it comes to changing your reservation.

Fish over cooked. Risotto a sloppy over cooked over creamy mess. Quail more like jerky. Salmon extremely underwealming. Very little actual flavor in the seafood red curry - seemingly cream with a red tinge and no depth of flavor at all. The meats were decently prepared, but by that time pretty disinterested.

I have always enjoyed GD. I've no idea what was going on last night but really terrible food. The people next to us seemed to think so too judging by the amount of food they left on their plates.Read more",Overall1

Gary Danko,"A restaurant with an incredible reputation, we went to celebrate a birthday and some personal accomplishments. I was impressed by the decor and overall feel of the place, also the service was overall outstanding but really only when dishes or drinks were brought to the table. There were times when it took minutes (to ask for the bill it took >5 min, the entire time i was keeping my eye out for the waiter) to get service. Again, not that the service was bad, it was pretty incredible, but for the money you are paying I shouldnt have to wait 5 minutes to be able to flag someone. 
The food....we had 7 courses in total (yes a lot of food) between two of us, it was really delicious! Highlights include the risotto, thai seafood curry, and the bison. The quail was pretty tasty with the mushroom and cornbread filling....it was a very interesting dish. The only dish i didnt like was the oyster dish...it was a 1/5. I like oysters (have never had them cooked though, these were cooked), and i was REALLY excited for them, but alas, they were completely underwhelming and in fact they weren’t even palatable (i really disliked them). Also, the bread is extremely average. Like grocery store bread is better than what they offer. It’s also cold. It’s nice as it will make you eat more of their food but the bread is usually a plus not a negative as in this case. The ambiance was fantastic, felt very fancy and elegant, I liked the vibe and the decorations. We were just a little too close to people on both sides. I felt anyone could have listened in on our conversation and our date just wasn’t very private. 
Overall, this is a great restaurant, the ambiance is chique, food is delicious (except for bread and oysters), service is on better side, but for a Michelin star restaurant and a  ~330$ bill between two people, it left a lot to be desired. They also got my congratulations wrong, which is bizarre because I was very clear in my reservation with what we were celebrating.Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"Let’s start w the bartender on the early / 5:30p shift on Friday July 12. He wasn’t efficient nor was he friendly. I had to ask for a water in addition to my drink. Felt he should have automatically asked me if I wanted a water or poured me one. He wasn’t at all friendly and did not check in with me at all as I had my glass of champagne. (Was waiting on our resie). I’d go as far to say that he was grumpy and snobby. Once we were seated in the restaurant, the waitress (short hair, large glasses, a bit older) rushed us and kept on rushing us throughout the meal. Frustrating. The best part of the service was the guy who brought the bread! Friendly. Mind you - I love the food, always have - and GD used to be the best cheese course this side of France. However, though the appetizers, meal and dessert were great - the cheese course now pales in comparison to what it once was. No cheese from France and many of the cheese were a bit pedestrian at least in comparison of what they used to offer. Finally, wine bottle list is fine - overpriced but that’s to be expected - and there are some gems. But! - the wines by the glass list is hideous and grossly TOO overpriced. So what used to hands down be a Relais Chateau 5 star dining experience is now wallowing at an average 3 rating...Read more",Overall3

Gary Danko,"Food was generally good not not special. Many restaurants in SF feel more creative and vital. Gary Danko seems to cater mainly to the tourist trade, and it is a little jarring to spend $400 on dinner only to be surrounded by little kids watching videos at the table, and tourists in shorts and t-shirts who have obviously been walking around all day. Oh well, what do you expect when you set up a restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf.

The service here was quite good, and the wine list was great. Several dishes on the menu were delicious, although many were safe to the point of being boring. The one real stinker on the menu was the salmon medallions - surprising since this is one of the dishes Gary Danko is known for. I found the salmon to be utterly tasteless and the horseradish flavor in the crust to be completely overpowering. In general, I found the food to be way under-salted (and I generally favor less salty food). I just found myself wanting to put salt on almost everything, perhaps to boost the flavors.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,We really enjoyed our dinner until later when one of us became very ill. What a bummer after such a wonderful yet insanely expensive meal. We also gave them a chance to make it right but they didn’t.,Overall3
Gary Danko,Our second trip to Gary Danko. Fantastic fine dining. Service that rivals nearly all the other Michelin starred restaurants but with additional warmth. Also a great value for the level of experience,Overall5
Gary Danko,"As a background I have been dining at Gary Danko for over 15 years. I have always enjoyed the experience. However, the last two times that I have dined there the experience was less than expected. I would like to comment that the food is consistently good and the wait staff is always professional. My review is not directed at them, however it is directed at the management style of the restaurant. In my most recent experiences I felt everything was very rushed. In fact, from the time my girlfriend and I sat down to the time we got our bill was slightly less than one hour. I might go to Denny’s or IHOP if I want to finish my meal in one hour, but I certainly do not go to Gary Danko to be rushed. Not sure that I will make plans to dine there again anytime soon. 

I sincerely hope that the management team of Gary Danko do you read these reviews. I would love to continue to be a guest at your restaurant but not under the circumstances where I have to shove food in my mouth this fast because the next course already coming.Read more",Overall1

Gary Danko,"Fantastic and fantastically expensive. However they were extremely accommodating as a fifth joined our party unplanned. The take-home treat was especially good: pineapple cake in a decorated wrapper. All the food was stupendous: lobster, cheese (comes out on a huge tray but looks scary and old; this doesn’t appear to be the cheese they serve you; cheese portions were dinky), artichoke soup with a great mushroom/cheese crouton toast, chocolate soufflé. My only complaint is that the first Cosmo was unimpressive. The second much better. At least they can improve...Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"This was our third time in SF in the last 10 years. We went to GD the first two visits and wanted to try a few other restaurants this time. Well out on our morning jog we wound up in front of the restaurant. We had to Make a last minute reso.
Arrived a few minutes early and sat at bar until table was ready. We were politely taken to our seats. 
Had a perfectly prepared dirty martini and my wife had a lovely glass of Chardonnay. 
Our amuse was a lettuce and bacon soup- wow liquid Cobb salad. Phenomenal!
I did 4 courses and my wife had 3. We also got a 1/2 bottle of reasonably priced white burgundy.
We had:
- Crab salad. Simply art on a plate. A bit bland but the sweet crab was spectacular. 
- Artichoke soup. Perfect balance of richness and the acidic artichoke. Yum!
- Maine lobster. Perfect in every way.
- Sea scallops. Can’t go wrong with peas and Morels. Scallops were explosive in sugar content that were exceptionally seared to Medium Rare.
- Stuffed Quail. Perfect simplicity. 
- Chocolate peanut bar. Pure heaven!
- Butter cake. Wow. The crunchy outside and velvety interior was to die for. 
To summarize. They have not lost a step. They continually knock it out of the park. 
The service also lived up to the food. 
If we had any gripe it would be the take away muffin. My wife and I talk about them year after year. This time they just did not live up to what we remembered. They were good however not the divine experience of the past two visits. These were smaller, dryer and there was little to no crumb. The taste was good however as we have preached over the years about them being life changing- this time they surely were not. 
All in all a spectacular evening. 
Cheers!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"To put into words how we were treated is impossible. When we requested for tuna to be done a certain temperature, the waitress look down on us like we didn't know what we were talking about. after we had out apps, they took my girlfriend's drink away cleaning up the table while she was still drinking it and when we mentioned something they again looked down on us and brought her a half a drink with the remark "" here is a fresh half a drink to make up for your half a drink"" after dessert which was the only good part of the whole dinner they brought out a little pineapple upside down cake wrapped up to take home. when we asked the waitress what it was she said this is your breakfast after you leave all your MONEY  here at Gary Danko !!!! HOW RUDE !!!! We felt belittled and judged. we have eaten at restaurants with Michelin 2 & 3 stars and that were triple the price of this sad disgusting restaurant. The food quality is not Michelin the service is a local diner at best. The only delicious thing we had was the soup and the desert. I got a duck it was okay at best, my friend's got two orders of seared tuna that I definitely make better at home. overall the food was okay at most but the service was a disgrace!!!!!!! I hope they get their Michelin star taken away because it's really bringing down the hole respect of the Michelin star restaurants.Read more",Overall1

Gary Danko,Great Restaurant for a night out.  Everything we ordered was delicious and service was perfect.  Loved the menu with options of a Tasting or pick your own courses.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"Service & food were great but it was more expensive than expected since the wine list contained fewer reasonable priced wines.  They have an extensive selection of Bordeaux and Burgundy wines which run higher than other French regions or comparable US wineries. Several tips for first time dinners. Unlike most course priced restaurants, this one allows you to mix any selections in your course selections such as three meat courses and their courses are larger sizes so two three course dinners for most couples should be enough to share especially since they provide a complimentary petit fours selection at the end of your meal along with “breakfast” cupcakes to take with you.Read more",Overall4

Old school again. Seemed to go through motions. No creativity. Although food was good, it’s tough to compete against some of the more up-and-coming chefs.

Gary Danko,"The décor at Gary Danko feels ""dated"". There is nothing ""contemporary"" about the experience.  We had not been there for a few years and we were disappointed.  The portions were small, the beef tenderloin was not tender and the servers rushed the first 3 courses and then we waited 20 minutes for the dessert course.  There were many servers, but none connected with us in a dialogue. Everything about it needs to be brought into the 21st century.Read more",Overall2

I ordered 3 courses off the regular menu and my SO ordered the 4 courses from the vegetarian menu. I enjoyed all my dishes for the most part - everything was just a tad bit on the salty side (and I usually love salt), and not sure if it was because it was a holiday weekend on a Sunday where main kitchen staff was off duty, but my SO’s vegetarian risotto was still undercooked (had crunchy bits), lacked flavor, and presentation was off - I know GD does great risotto and food is usually on point, but this must of been an off day.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"It’s our favorite go-to place for any special occasion for years. Being a bit old fashioned, I was really disappointed about the lack of dress code enforcement.

The risotto, sea scallops, pork tenderloin, duck breast with hash and finished it off with a decadent Louisiana butter cake. Bravo!

Coupla small misses- bread choice was limited to one rather than the traditional 3-4. There were no gluten free options.  The red wine was served  quite cold.

Gary Danko,"We had been planning a trip to Gary Danko for several months, and finally made a reservation. This was my second visit and the first for my wife.  Given the reputation of the restaurant, we both went in with high expectations. The ambiance is warm and inviting and has an intimate feel; perfect for a romantic meal or any special occasion. The staff is as professional and friendly as one would expect for a restaurant of this caliber. We were warmly greeted and promptly seated at our table.  We are pescatarians, and an appropriate chef selection was included in our menu which was a very nice touch. We both felt that our primary waiter came on a bit strong and his attempt at humor fell flat on us. We both opted for the wine pairing, and the sommelier made selections that were well matched to each of our dishes. I was not enjoying the selection that was paired with my salmon dish, and when I commented to the sommelier, he promptly offered a replacement. We both had a crab salad that was very good with generous portions of fresh dungeness crab. I had a horseradish crusted salmon that was good, but not exceptional. My wife ordered an artichoke soup that was probably the best dish of the evening. We also both had scallops that were cooked perfectly and were very flavorful. All of the dishes were very good, but the artichoke soup is the only dish that stood out. Our overall experience was good, but i think that my wife enjoyed it more being her first visit.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"This was our first time visit.  We were celebrating our 30th  Anniversary. on 31 March. Our reservation was for 6:00 P.M. we arrived about 5:40. The  Maitre de took my wife's coat, seated us in a side room of the restaurant, and took our drink order.  I knew right away we were being seated in the ""Peanut Gallery"". The service was very prompt, perfunctory, and with feigned congeniality.  My Manhattan and my wife's Martini were both served promptly. About half way through our drinks, our waiter Dennis came to take our food and wine order. The appetizers were served almost immediately after we ordered. The Ahi & Risotto were both delicious. Our main courses were served shorty after we finished our appetizers. The Pork Tender Loin and Scallops entrees along with two wine selections were both very good. However, as soon as we finished the main course, our desserts were served along with Port Wine. Bottom line, we were rushed through our dinner. We were on our way by 7:00 P.M. By the time we could enjoy anything we were served another course. It was apparent that the regulars or ""Glitterati"" receive the best tables and service. We have dined at the French Laundry,  Chez Pannis,  Boulevard, and many other fine restaurants all over the world. This was not a fun dining experience this was a race by the staff to turn the table over.  Live and learn a $500 tab doesn't necessarily bring you a good meal at Gary Danko's.  

I see the other reviews and note that everyone is raving. So maybe during the week is a better time to dine there but not on a Saturday night in San Francisco.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,Amazingly attentive service- not stuffy but great for a special bday.

Gary Danko,"I treated my husband to his birthday celebration at Gary Danko. We each chose the four course option. The food was delicious but we were disappointed with the service and overall experience. I do not drink and my husband just wanted a glass of wine. When the sommelier realized we were only ordering one glass of wine his manner changed and he said “Oh, okay...” like we needn’t be bothered with. We saw how the tables around us who ordered add-on items and multiples bottles of wine were treated with more attention from the staff. Multiple servers were at those tables for their every request while I had to ask for a steak knife for my lamb. It was disheartening to realize the experience would have been different had we ordered more.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"This is our third or fourth time at Gary Danko—we took friends who have never been there before.  The food was phenomenal—every small morsel was accented to perfection, both in terms of flavor and in terms of presentation.  We had the salmon with crusted horseradish—a favorite; one of our friends had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked.  Three of us had the beef fillets, while one of us had the branzini.  The branzini skin was crisped and the sauce accompanying it was flavorful, while the blended fennel hit just the right note.  But the filet!  It was like the best piece of salty candy or candies salt you’ve ever had.  Tender but cooked well, and served with potatoes that melted with the crisped potatoes, any of us would order it again and again.  The cheese course had a bazillion choices—and you get to choose four.  I chose a combination of cow and sheep’s milk, and large portions of each were served with thin slices of delicious raisin bread and grapes.  For dessert:  chocolate soufflé with two sauces—one creme anglaise and one bittersweet chocolate, with both melting into the crunchy and smooth beauty of the souffles.  And at the end, they give you a tiny plate of cookies and a muffin to take home for breakfast!  This is a special occasion restaurant that I wish we could visit every month.Read more",Overall5

Table bread wasn’t warm, and cold unsweetened/unsalted butter wasn’t the easiest time to spread, but the bread was a decent wheat version of freshly sliced baguette, soft middle with crunchy crust.
The sommelier knew his wines, could take you on an adventure during tastings. Unfortunately, pairing with entrees was more difficult due to the variation of flavors available, and getting both a red and white to cover all the possibilities was tough, for our palettes. 
Staff was friendly and helpful, not overbearing or belittling in any way, attentive to quickly remove dishes and replace silverware each course.
The courses, approach with an open mind at times but hold your standards. The lobster with potato purée was good if you avoid the bold blood orange and added a touch of lemon juice. I’ve never had scallops not flipped and served the correct temperature, with the done side a crispy buttered “end” that would over power the soft scallop if not parsed into diced portions. Watch the risotto, while sauced correctly, my serving was rice half uncooked the first go.
We enjoyed selecting 4 types from the cheese tray before entrees arrived.
She was less impressed with her cooler than medium salmon, which could have had the skin pan crisped in butter like my scallops.
The pork tenderloin was a good experience we both agreed needs to stay on the menu through the year, savory and sweet and satisfying texture of being served the perfect temperature. I felt the lemon pepper duck was closer to a comfort food flavor, medallions soft and bits of thick maple bacon accompanying the duck and hash, another great mix.
If you want to wow a date with feeling exclusive, this is a good choice.

Gary Danko,"Small and cosy restaurant. Arrived for a 7.45pm booking to a very busy restaurant with people waiting for their tables and a full bar so there was no where to really wait.

We ordered from the a la Carte menu. The food was good and what you would expect from a good restaurant.

Food service was good, but drinks service was a bit slow. 

Overall, it was a good experience but found this restaurant a little overpriced for a good fine dining experience.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,We have been to Gary Danko many times as we always celebrate our special occasions at your lovely restaurant.  Food and service are excellent.  I just have one negative comment.  The bread you serve with meals and the cheese course is not great.  The night we were there - February 21 - all bread was not served warm and seemed to be stale.  The bread was hard and dry.  Just a comment - perhaps it had been sitting out before serving but I like breads to be served warm.Read more,Overall4

Gary Danko,"My wife and I had guests visiting from overseas. we decided to invite them for a very special dinner at Gary Danko.
Positives: 
The food was excellent.  The wine manager a great guy. The personnel (Bread, water, food dishes and cheese servers) were all superb.
Negatives: 
1. Very rude valet staff (It was raining heavily when we arrived. As soon as I opened my car door, the first valet guy came to me and shouted ""20 dollars"". I had my guests with me in the car and did not want to make a scene so I told him to follow me to a dry area near the entrance to the restaurant. As I was reaching for my wallet, the second valet guy standing behind the valet desk started shouting ""20 dollars  20 dollars"". I asked him to relax and to lower his voice but he got very defensive and embarrassed me in front of my guests.
2. Our waitress had a chip on her shoulder during the entire dinner. When I asked her why it is taking so long to get the wine, she said ""You are not the only customer here. The wine manager is busy with other customers"". The kindness of the wine manager and the cheese cart guy later made up for her rude behavior.
3. At the table next to ours  (to my immediate right) there was a party of 4 very loud young asians (2 males and 2 females) behaving as if they were at Burger King.
Overall, our guests were very pleased and except for the 3 negative experiences that I listed above, I was too.
Hopefully, next time I will have a perfect experience.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We went to celebrate a job promotion and CNY.  After they seated  us and got our drink order they kept us waiting for over an hour for our first course.  They didn't even offer a drink, top up our water glass, nothing.

The caviar we ordered is from Costco.  At Gary Danko we had Costco food.

Then, they fed us mud.  Didn't bother washing the vegetables. See photos.

We couldn't finish our entree and boxed it.  And as we had ordered the 4 course we boxed the cheese.

They offered us a dessert wine as a consolation but  it had cork bits floating in it.

We got home and was sick.

We paid $886.09 

This is a restaurant that once was wonderful now it has the conceit to believe it can treat customers poorly and like idiots.

After writing them about this they agreed to refund us back our tip $100.Read more",Overall1

Gary Danko,"SF is a great restaurant city, but from my standpoint, Gary Danko is the best.  Every aspect of the service is impeccable, from check-in all the way through to finish.   I want to point out the service is not at all stuffy and every person we encountered was friendly and helpful.  We ordered the wine pairing with our meal and the sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable about each wine and how they matched with the food.  We were also very impressed with the pacing of the courses.  It's not easy to maintain this pacing during a 5 course meal, but Gary Danko does it extremely well.  The food itself is spectacular.  Every course had an excellent selection and we were very satisfied with our choices.  The presentation on the plates is beautiful and appealing.  The fourth course was the cheese course, which is an experience in and of itself!  We love Gary Danko and can't wait to go back.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"I have been to Gary Danko quite a few times and I always recommend it for guests and special occasions.
Unfortunately, this time the group of 5 were unanimous in saying that it was nothing memorable.
The complimentary consomme that came out, which we were told to ""drink immediately"" while it was hot...was cold/lukewarm.  I had the glazed oyster appetizer and it was chewy and tasted like it was not very fresh.  The seared filet of beef was supposed to be served at medium rare was cooked medium  and the beef had a strange consistency.  One person in our party said it had a tasted like liver.  I had the seared scallops which was good and someone in our party had the curried broccoli soup, which they enjoyed.
I am almost sad to say that it is no longer a place I would recommend.  It had always been my longtime favorite.  There are a lot of other great restaurants in San Francisco and this may no longer be one of them.   Acquerello or Boulevard  would be a step up.Read more",Overall2

The highlights, the curried broccoli soup. It was divine. I had the filet of beef which was possibly the best steak I have ever eaten. With onion jam and bleu cheese butter....if this is wrong I don’t want to be right. Finally, the grand-marnier soufflé. Just get it. I will never find another dessert that makes me that happy. Ever.

Gary Danko,"Most over rated restaurant I've ever been to!!! At least at McDonald's they don't talk themselves up to being something they're not... We were forced to order more food because the manager didn't want us to split food and the prices are so outlandish that you almost have to take a second out on your house. spliting a three course meal for $100 and they made us order more because they basically wanted to make more profit...

Gary Danko,"As an SF resident, I have been a client of this restaurant for years. Over the last 2 years, it has felt that this restaurant is all about diner turn-over. Get them in, get them out. The service level has decreased significantly, as has the presentation and ambience. We began receiving our food before we even had drinks, and our server offered on several occasions to ‘choose for us’ as we obviously did not choose our cheese course quickly enough. The server did not even explain the various cuts of cheese being offered. Just ‘here it is, and I can choose for you’ ... I also felt the presentation pf the food was lackluster. I am an iced tea drinker, and every time I wanted more iced tea, I had to ask for it. Same with my dinner companion’s cocktail. Overall, the food was tasty, however the experience of fine dining at Gary Danko has become an experience of fast-food dining - at a premium price. There are many, many fine-dining restaurants in San Francisco, and the next time I am considering a fine-dining restaurant, I will very likely consider other choices.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,Surprisingly nonplussed by the Experience. There was little to distinguish food selection and presentation from any other well respected steakhouse so the Michelin star designation seemed unnecessary. Service was very attentive and warm except for when we needed some cutlery towards dessert- everyone including the floor manager was preoccupied and never looked around even as I raised my hand a couple times which is almost impossible to miss in such a quaint sitting space. The bathroom access is right behind the server station and sandwiched next to the kitchen entrance. There is only one uni-sex bathroom which means you need to smash yourself into the wall while waiting if it’s occupied lest the server door smack you or a server steps backward after punching in an order. All this would be acceptable if the food stood out as anticipated but it didn’t. Bathroom was nice clean and well appointed and the dining area was comfy and sophisticated even if the tables were kinda cramped. Valet parking is something like $20 or $40 dollars I forget but I just know it was high and you pay in advance and there’s no way to put it on your tab - good thing I had cash since there was no warning on OpenTable. The after dinner cheese service was the highlight of the experience as they bring out a huge cart explaining all the options and cut your choices right in front of you. That was good and the variety and selection was excellent. Overall I expected more from. Michelin restaurant but I didn’t regret trying it out.Read more,Overall4

The food and the service are exquisite - deeply rooted in the traditional French style, but executed in a way that feels modern and approachable.

Gary Danko,"I have been going to Gary Danko for over a dozen years. Although not the most creative they have always excuted their steady menu, until now. In order to limit food costs I am guessing, the portions have become quite small. Seared foie gras was small and not well seared, the torchon was poorly salted and lacked flavor, scallops needed salt also, and the rum cake recommended was way too sweet. This is not the Gary Danko I am accustomed to. 

They executed their dishes beautifully in the past with the highest quality ingredients. This time too many rookie mistakes. And who sent out dishes without quality checks? It wouldn’t be Gary Danko. Disappointed.Read more",Overall4

From the amuse bouche to the dessert, the food was top notch especially the Ahi Tuna starter.

Gary Danko,"Was there celebrating my boyfriends birthday. He ordered a drink and immediately noticed that there were fruit flies in his drink. I think the server noticed as he was putting the cup down but didn’t say anything. My boyfriend told the server about it and they replaced it. Typically, a restaurant would give you a discount or take it off the tab; neither happened. The expectation at any restaurant is not to have fruit flies, let alone a Michelin star rated restaurant. There was a fruit fly roaming around the entire time throughout dinner. Not worth the $355 tab for two.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,"We don’t live in San Francisco so this was only our second visit.   If Gary Danko were in our city, we’d frequent it much more often.  What we like most about it is the expansive and very approachable menu (we each could have selected 5 items in each category). In addition, everyone who works there from the hostess at the front door to the maitre d’ to the person who took our order, the sommelier, and the people who bussed our table, the service was professional and exceptional. Our anniversary dinner could not have been better, more delicious, served more beautifully or enjoyed more.Read more",Overall5

We will definitely  come here for another special occasion.",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Took my husband here for a date night while visiting San Francisco. Good quality food which is cooked well with reasonable size portions. Cocktails were okay, nothing to write home about.

Gary Danko,We were stuck in traffic and arrived nearly 40 minutes late but they were so accommodating and we were able to be seated once we arrived.  Service was top notch and the food was so well done— my boyfriend is a very picky eater and he enjoyed all of the dishes.

Gary Danko,"We had a crab appetizer that was excellent, as was the smoked salmon and caviar on buckwheat cake.  The seafood risotto and bison stakes with German dumplings were also excellent.  The only (small) disappointment was the lemon mousse cake.   It was very good but tasted more like cheese cake than mousse, and did not appear to be made during the time we had dinner.  My friend had a chocolate mousse which tasted like mousse, and I would recommend that.Read more",Overall4

We were reassured that none of our plates would have onions. We ordered the lamb, and it came with a large quantity of onions. It may have just been a simple mistake, but it shouldn’t be happening at this restaurant. Aside from being disappointed, I might not be back for a while.

Gary Danko,While the restaurant is lovely and the service impeccable the food did not leave a lasting impression. The food was good but in my opinion not worthy of the level of restaurant and accolades it claims to be. Glad we have eaten here but won’t be back. Too many other great dining experiences in the city to enjoy. It was nice that you could decide on how many courses to have and that portion sizes are adjusted accordingly.Read more,Overall4
Gary Danko,"We were blown away with the cuisine and service on our first visit to Gary Danko.
While guests can choose a chef’s tasting menu, the a la carte menu has many selections of appetizers, seafood, meats, and desserts.  Guests can pick whatever 2, 3, or 4 items they wish.  Four desserts?  Why not!  It was hard to choose, as there were so many more things we wanted to try.
The wine service was outstanding.  For one course, our server poured the wine pairing that was not on the wine list, and she poured half glasses on request so we could pair a wine with each course.
And the little touches (amuse bouche, a dessert with a candle, a box of little cakes to take home) were delightful.  We’ll be back.  We liked Gary Danko over our last visit to the French Laundry.Read more",Overall5

I started with the risotto appetizer, followed by the lobster and then the chocolate soufflé (which was the highlight of the meal).   I hate that I haven't tried many other dishes on the menu but since I only visit SF once a year, I like to stay with the tried and true.  The restaurant also has a good selection of half bottles of wine which makes it nice since my husband drinks red and I drink white.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,Excellent food from a wide menu with good choices. Excellent wine list especially range of half bottle choices. Service was absolutely brilliant.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"Very lovely dinner, great food, wine, attentive service and quiet ambience. The only drawback would have to be the slightly squeezy feel restaurant and the toilet being behind the waiter's service area, which means you'd have to walk past all the servers who are preparing to serve dishes and be careful not to bump into any of them.
All in all, it was still a wonderful experience and I would go back again. Recommended for dates and business dinners.

Gary Danko,"The wine and food were great but the service was disappointing.  We felt rushed throughout our meal and the server was very unfriendly. She asked us 3 times for our meal preferences before our wine was presented which isn’t proper.  We insisted on making a toast before we ordered our entrees!

Gary Danko,"The food was absolutely fabulous. I love the  tasting menu option as well as the option to build your own menu with the set prices. Allows you to try so many different amazing options. Came with a party of 4 and we all loved everything we ordered. And I must add that the coctail that we had to start while waitinf for our table was amazing. I can't stop thinking about it. I wanted to go back the next night just for a cocktail.  
Where I think they can imporve on is the intial experience. I dine regularly at establishments like Gary Danko and while I know the Valet is contracted out they do represent the restaurant and the experience. They did not greet us, in fact they stood behind their podium and looked at us until we got out of the car and walked up to them and asked for service. Usually someone stopping in the middel of street right in front of a valet podium generally wants valet service. Did not say anting just grabbed the keys. No one opened the door for us even though there was someone standing there (and we were 4 ladies). The hostess was quite dull too. She defintiely acted like she hated her job and was not happy to be there or to have dining guests.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"As I had tasted Gary Danko's cuisine before when he was the chef at the Ritz Carlton and in his restaurant in San Mateo, I expected at least that level of cooking, but I was disappointed with two of my three courses.  The crab salad with avocado and quinoa had a distinct flavorful taste.  But the risotto with crab and rock shrimp barely had any taste and no rock shrimp and while the Maine lobster was plentiful, the potato puree was totally tasteless and had no hint of mushrooms.  While the service was attentive, the waiter steered us to expensive wines by the glass without showing us the menu.  The meal was expensive, but poor value.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,"All I can say is “wow”!  This was my second time there and it was even better than the first time 2 years ago. The service remains impeccable.  I don’t know how they do it. Everything is taken care of in seamless fashion with servers visiting and checking on you all of the time but it is never snooty or annoying.  Amazing. And then the food!  I had two of the best dishes I have ever had including at three star Michelin restaurants in Paris, Bordeaux, San Sebastián and Reims.  The oysters with caviar appetizer was perfection - captures the briny sea with perfection in taste and color and the scallops dish was perfectly cooked and perfectly accompanied by a pea based sauce that brought out the sweetness of the scallops perfectly.  And then there was the wine pairings-Jeremiah the Master Sommelier Wine Director (one of 236 in the world) put together the most exquisite wine pairings with each dish that were both surprising and original and perfectly paired to bring out the best in each dish - Txaolina with the oysters; dry muscat with the scallops.  Genius.  How this place does not have three Michelin stars baffles the mind.  A wonderful memorable evening.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Nearly 24 years ago at our wedding reception for 250 at the SF Ritz Carleton, Gary Danko was the Chef.  People are STILL talking about how fabulous the food was then. 

Now, my husband and I will be remembering for as many, or more, years his birthday dinner at Gary Danko Restaurant. 

Sure, it is a bit pricey, but well worth it. And our primary server (there are many working each of the two lovely, well-appointed dining rooms), Boris, was a delight. 

Depending on your pocketbook, one might even be able to eat this incomparable food more than once every quarter century. I recommend it, if possible, to dine here for at least special occasions - like it is a Wednesday. 

We chose 4 and 5 courses, sharing the cheese course. And what a delight the cheese cart is!

Everything was great. Some standouts were the scallops, and a risotto course, oh! and stuffed quail ETC!

A truly lovely, and not stuffy (no neckties on men!) yet elegant memorable dining experience. 

Go, if you possibly can and make your necessary reservations in advance as they can be difficult to obtain. 

Enjoy and savor!!!!",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Gary Danko's is a fine dining mecca in San Francisco.  We have wanted to come for years and finally celebrated our 35th anniversary with a splurge.  You can choose a 3, 4 or 5 course meal from the menu - and I mean choose.  Want two appetizers and an entree? Fine.  Want two entrees, a cheese course and dessert? Fine.  Or you can opt for the 5-course tasting menu with or without wine pairing.

We opted for the four course meal with a marvelously creamy Shrimp and Crab risotto as our starter and a wonderful Vermentino white wine.  Then went on to a Fish course and finished with a pork and a beef course respectively with a delightful Grenache Blend.  All melt in your mouth delicious.

The desserts, a lemon souffle cake and a cherries flambe, were heaven on a plate.  

Gary Danko's is higher priced than many restaurants, but for this level of service and cuisine, the  prices, starting at $92 for three courses, are reasonable for a Michelin Starred restaurant.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Our all time favorite restaurant.  Consistency is the key!  Cooking from every dining experience has been excellent!  However, We must mention the customer service level of the hostess  has gone down drastically.  Please!  You are the very first impression of the restaurant. Smile and welcome your guests!  Not a word of welcoming, not a SMILE!  A robotic generic tone of: “we are getting your table ready, you are welcome to have a drink at the bar while we do that”.  It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.  At an upscale restaurant like this, I call it totally unacceptable.  In addition, please please strictly enforce the restaurant’s dress code. Not this visit, but the last dining experience.  We were literally sitting next to two young Asian guests that were dressed in hooded sweatshirts and basketball sneakers.  I was so embarrassed as I am Asian myself!  For a moment, we thought we were at a different  restaurant.  We were very much in shocked that the restaurant did not bother of enforcing the dress code at all.  Please, at the reputation the restaurant has built, you do not need guests who do not respect other guests nor the restaurant.  On top of it, they degrade your reputation as a Michelin Star fine dining restaurant!  Please please Strictly enforce dress code!Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Gary Danko’s Michelin-starred contemporary French restaurant in the Fisherman’s Wharf neighborhood was a luxurious dining experience to be sure.  The clean, stylish and modern exterior was a strong juxtaposition to the dark, moody atmosphere within, where massive floral arrangements, contemporary art, and Buddha statues created a Zen oasis for the mindful contemplation of food.  It was a busy night, but Jake and all the staff were extremely welcoming and attentive. Jake immediately put me at ease about my gluten-free concerns informing me that there were many items on the menu that were gluten free and the kitchen was willing and able to make modifications without compromising the essence of the dish.  We decided to order four courses and each beautifully plated course was brought to life Chef Danko’s attention to detail and creative use of fresh, locally-sourced products. (Special kudos to the kitchen for getting their hustle on when I realized that I was still hungry after my third course and decided to order a fifth just before the cheese cart arrived!)  The wine list was an excellent compliment to the menu and the cheese cart did not leave us disappointed.  Overall, we would recommend Gary Danko to anyone looking for a delicious fine-dining experience with personalized service in a Zen atmosphere.Read more",Overall4

The service is impeccable as is the food although I gave 4 stars rather than 5 because my entree, the lamb, was unremarkable. If this wasn't a celebration dinner with friends/clients, I would have sent it back. Otherwise, everything was out of this world and offered generous portions for a restaurant of this caliber.Read more",Overall5

Not sure what happened, and when I raised it with their manager ""Brian"", the response I received was essentially a denial that anything went wrong.  Francis, Foreign Cinema, La Folie, and Octavia are much better bets.Read more",Overall1

We make a change on our dessert choices before our meal start, but end up there was a confusion and they send the wrong dessert for my friend. Though the server come to clarify but she didn’t even say sorry or admit that they might have make a mistake, they just simply say there might be some confusion as we changes our choices. Was it my fault? She make it sound like it was. Pretty disappointed for a Michelin 1-Star restaurant.Read more",Overall2

We lost count there were so many different people waiting on our table and the food was terrific and a great value as far as high end tasting menus go.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"We thoroughly enjoyed our entire experience at Gary Danko. We liked the course selection and freedom to select how and what we wanted from each course menu. The wine list was extensive and overall lots of reasonably priced selections however we did splurge on 2 bottles that were just delicious. Our food was excellent with very few - if any- changes we would make. Lobster, duck, lamb- all delicious! The atmosphere was understated and classy but not stuffy and the service was great. So wonderful to go to a highly recommended restaurant- and not inexpensive- and feel that it lived up to what we hoped it would be.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,A terrible and mediocre restaurant. The perfunctory service was as if we were in a communist society where the servers were machine like or orchestrated. They interrupted our conversation too many times and too many servers came in at too frequent intervals. The food was mediocre. The deserts were oversized and filled with sugar. No sophisticated tastes at all.,Overall1
Gary Danko,"Food was not tasty. The salmon was so bad that we couldn’t even eat it. The rest of the dishes were average and below average. Service was also poor, it took forever until someone acknowledged that we were there and brought over a menu. Took almost 30 minutes to get our drinks. Would not be back and wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.",Overall2
Gary Danko,Gary Danko was everything I thought it would be...first class from the superb bar service to our eventual table service with excellent culinary choices.  The staff even saw us to door to end the night on a high note.  No stone was left unturned and for that I consider the value of the dinner to be commensurate with our experience.  I will return and could even be called upon for a more descriptive accounting of my evening if I thought it would  help to expose more “foodies” to GD!Read more,Overall5
Gary Danko,Almost $600.00 for 3 -3 course dinners and 2 wine pairings.  Extremely small portions with the largest portion being dessert. Unremarkable food. We were advised that we should not do our small gift exchange in the restaurant.   I would not go back and will not recommend it to anyone.,Overall1

Gary Danko,Very disappointed that when our wallet was left under the table that management would not retrieve it for us. We were told that management did not want to disturb the patrons dining at that time. We are also patrons of Gary Danko and I believe that everyone understands the stress that goes along with a lost wallet and that they wouldn't not have felt inconvenienced by management retrieving the wallet. So disappointing and terrible policy!Read more,Overall3
Gary Danko,"En nuestra última noche en San Francisco, mi esposa pidió el menú de tres tiempos (risotto, langosta y pato) y yo uno de cuatro tiempos (atún sellado, callo de hacha, filete y souffle de grand marnier). El servicio,  sabor y presentación de los alimentos fue lo que esperábamos, pero los primeros platos no llegaron calientes: tuvimos que regresar el risotto que estaba bastante frío. Vale la pena indicar que el mesero se sintió muy apenado por la temperatura y trajo un plato nuevo, pero no se nos ofreció ninguna compensación (por ejemplo: postre adicional, cafés, licor) y nosotros no la pedimos.

Por otro lado, el sommelier nos recomendó un buen vino muy semejante a lo que le describimos y de los más accesibles en cuanto a precio.

En general, estuvo muy bueno pero no sé si es tan bueno que vale lo que cuesta (con propina fueron casi $200 USD por persona). Es un punto para el ""bucket list"" pero hasta ahí.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"This is my first visit to this famous restaurant. I was so exited about being there before visit, but so disappointed after my visit.
I try to select a glass of red wine but there are no selection on the menu we got. I found the menu we get could be a desert wine lists. I found they have another wine menu with a glass of red wines. 
I chose three course dinner. Seared Ahi tuna is very fresh, I could say freshest tuna I ever had in US and I could taste the tuna itsself with light seasoning. I selected buffalo steak as my waiter recommended. But this was my big mistake.  Meat is VERY hard, may be over cooked, and the source is too salty and too sweet. I want give you 1 star for this dish. For the desert, I asked my waiter least sweet item, and he recommended creme brulee. That is three cup of blulee with each one has regular size. And, the one I start is TOO sweet and has little umami. 
I am so sorry to compare with other restaurant, but this restaurant is totally different from other excellent restaurant like Chez Panisse.  I just visit wrong place. 
サンフランシスコで「超」有名なレストランで、行く前はとても期待していたのですが、行ってみてガッカリ。おいしい食事をしたいのならお勧めでは無いです。
最初に出してきたワインメニューがデザートワインしか無かったり（追加で注文時には正しいのを出してくれました）、ウエイターお勧めのバッファローのステーキが、肉は焼き過ぎでパサパサ、ソースは塩っ辛過ぎ、それでいて砂糖山盛り。うまみなんて感じれれませんでした。デザートのプリンも甘すぎ。そういえば、ナパの有名なフレンチでも塩辛かった経験があるので、今アメリカでは塩っ辛いのが流行っているのかもしれません。Chez Panisseの繊細な美味しさとは大違いです。Read more",Overall2

At $87 for 3 courses it was excellent value . I had foie gras,lobster and duck , my husband had tuna, scallops  ,bison and a trio of creme brûlées.
The waiters were excellent very attentive and knowledgeable.
You can have 3 or 4 course tasting with a large choice of options and the whole table does not have to have the same number of courses which was great.
My only comment is that the restaurant is a little dated and for an older clientele although there were people there in jeans.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Food was fabulous but we would love it if they had a cheese menu. My wife is visually impaired and had a hard time seeing the tiny signs on the cheeses. We also thought that given the high prices, the tables should be farther apart. It was very cramped when the waiters were serving the table next to me- I had to move every time.",Overall3
Gary Danko,"As wonderful as ever.  Professional, gracious service.  Call out to the sommelier for assistance navigating the world-class and voluminous wine list.  Great way to organize the ordering process and several outrageously good options in all categories.  #1 stand-out this time was Glazed Oysters.  Not a low cost evening but worth every $",Overall5

We had just had an amazing meal at a Michelin 3 star restaurant in Europe 3 weeks before returning to have dinner at Gary Danko for the first time in about 2 years;  so I was curious ( and somewhat apprehensive) about how Gary Danko would compare.

Gary Danko,"Absolutely amazing. The waiters were all super friendly and accommodating. They had two main priorities - to make sure we were fed and full at the end, and to make sure we understood and enjoyed the dishes we ordered. They took extra time to explain to us the different cheeses and gave great recommendations on what dishes to order given the other courses in our meal. My friend and I both did a five-course dinner - he did the tasting menu and I chose the seared foie gras, the torchon, maine lobster, lamb, and creme brulee trio. Out of the 10 different dishes we selected, our favorites included the seared foie gras, maine lobster, oysters, and cheese platter (Shropshire, Chimay, Ossau-Iraty, Harbison). In addition to the meal, they gave us a complimentary amuse bouche (watermelon gazapacho) and a tray of sweets as a second dessert. At the end, they also gave us each a pineapple cake to take home, which we ate the next morning. We absolutely loved the experience. Their menu is super flexible and not everyone has to choose the same number of dishes. Another thing I appreciated is that the waiter let me try one of their drinks before I actually ordered it since I sounded rather hesitant on the matter. Highly recommend!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,It  was awesome!!! They gave me birthday cake. They also have good manner. Food was nice,Overall5
Gary Danko,"The food is absolutely delicious from appetizers to main dishes to deserts.
The only negative aspect is sometimes the service is too quick.
The servers come around too quickly to take the plates off the table. One is hardly done with their dish that the servers are collecting the plates. A little slower would be best to really enjoy the atmosphere.
Other than that, it's a great restaurant!Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,A wonderful meal served by people who live their jobs. We were so well taken care of from the entry to the end of the evening. The food was plentiful and excellent in presentation and quality. Can't say enough positives about this fine dining locale.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"We have dined at Gary Danko at least three times in the past 20 years on special occasions.  We enjoyed each occasion.  Unfortunately, this time was not as satisfying.  Although the service was exceptional, the Price has gone way up.  I know that is not unusual in today's economy, but, in my opinion, Gay Danko's increase is over the top.  The experience simply does not justify the cost.

Surprisingly, my desert (the New Orleans Butter Cake) was hard.  Had it not been, I would still have thought the value was not there.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,"The food at GARY DANKO never disappoints, however, i must say that some of what makes it extraordinary was missing this time.
I didn't feel as if I was given much help on the selection of our wine. Opening the book to re Italian wines is still overwhelming. Finally settled on something I knew from France.
Worst of all was the waiters picking up our plates before everyone was finished eating. One person was left eating by himself. 
Finally our host was asked repeatedly whether he needed a cab or had a claim check for his car. This felt like the bumb's rush.

Gary Danko,"I expected a lot more for the reputation and price. We did the full tasting menu with the wine pairing, and not one of the dishes with the exception of the cheese cart was particularly memorable. The food was all good, and well executed, just not particularly exceptional in any way. Definitely not worth the 300 us all in this ended up being.",Overall3
Gary Danko,Below average for San Francisco. We could have prepared similar food at home.,Overall3
Gary Danko,"The ambiance score is solely attributable to the close proximity of the tables, about 6"" apart, so one must pull out and turn the table to access the banquet. We had a boorish drunken neighbor and the combination detracted from our enjoyment. However, the food was very good to great, the wine list a treasure, the sommelier a wonderful guide. Will return.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Big name in SF. very good service. For the price, food was ok but nothing more and Extremely overpriced. One dish came a little cold(duck)

Gary Danko,"We took a friend for a birthday. We go out to fine dining restarants frequently in  San Francisco and  internationally and have high standards. 

The food for the most part was delicious. But my partner's sea bass was too dry to be edible. You do not want to hear that about a main course being to dry at this fine dining establishment. 

Plus the room was next to the bar and got intolerably loud. We were having to yell at each other to talk. 

And there were too many servers and dish handlers in the small room...hustling and bustling along and distracting us from our friends and the food. Plus they all got frenetic and a server took the food that my friend was still eating.  

I saw a lot of little cakes with candles during the meal but THEY FORGOT MY FRIEND'S  birthday and when we realized it it was too late. 

We know this is a great restaurant but they certainly had a bad day for us that day. 

We will not be backRead more",Overall3

We had the wine pairing dinner.  The food was awesome, the pairings were perfect and the portions were just right.

The staff was exemplary, being constantly attentive, very knowledgeable about the foot and the wine being served.

We can't afford to go to Gary's as often as Norm goes to Cheers but for a special occasion, you can't beat Gary Danko's.

Gary Danko,"My husband took me to GD to celebrate my birthday and we had a fantastic evening, great food and very professional service. However, the decor of the restaurant seems quite dated, very very dark and a bit claustrophobic. And the wine list is very over-priced.

Gary Danko,"The food itself was very good and creative as one would expect at a high-end restaurant such as Gary Danko but what really set them apart for me was their service, which was welcoming, friendly, highly polished and professional.  Other restaurants could learn a great deal from Gary Danko.  I also appreciated that their fixed price menu offered numerous selections for each course, and that one could order more than one item from each course if so desired.  (My wife ordered three entrees.) Also, just about every item on their menu  was appealing to me, and even the three-course meal was more than enough. Finally, although the restaurant was completely full, we were easily able to carry on a conversation.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"We arrived early for our 5:30 reservation and we were greeted warmly and were seated promptly.  

Service was outstanding - attentive without the pretension.  Drinks were always filled.

Cocktails : Old Fashioned - my friend said it was the best he ever had at a restaurant

Wine : Sommelier's pairing with each course was spot on

Food : We really appreciate the flexibility for the table to do a la carte, chef's tasting menu or create your own tasting menu.  Not everyone has the same appetite and all the other Michelin Starred restaurants should have this policy.  Our server was able to accommodate the different number of courses ordered by our table without skipping a beat.  What a wonderful way to enjoy your meal!  All the dishes were seasoned perfectly and the chef nailed the temperature on all the protein.  The Glazed Oyster and Stuffed Quail were both outstanding!

Dessert: Make sure you order the STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE!  You will never go back to the Grand Mariner or Chocolate souffle.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"As always, Gary Danko was a real treat both in terms of service and food/wine. We had a lovely corner table with a bench seat in the quieter, back dining room. Began with expertly crafted cocktails, then two tasting menus/wine pairings. Of note was the 2012 Mad Hatter Cabernet, beef medallion with Stilton butter,  and the lemon souffle cake. All of it was top-notch but the standouts were truly lovely.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"It's my 4th time dining here. The food hasn't disappointed until now. But for me the service always disappoint and I felt I need to leave this review because this was a repeated issue for me. Three out of the four times, my party and I felt forgotten. Wait in between dishes is understandable if our order wasn't ready. But we sat and observed other parties getting their attentive care while we waited 35 mins just for the check. Can't even wave anyone down because they never looked our way. Even the table next to us had the same long wait. If waiting 35 mins for the check is the norm I understand. But I sat and observed the inequality amongst different diners. Only reason I returned was the food but will not be returning anymore.Read more",Overall3

No offense, but at this price point, I'd sooner recommend places like the Village Pub.",Overall4

Our waiter was very friendly & helpful.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko’s is the epitome of fine dining. Not only is every single dish prepared to perfection, they make their guests feel special from the moment they are greeted until they bid you farewell. Their staff is, I believe, superbly trained, hence, GD’s service is impeccable elevating your entire dining experience. It’s the little details that they pay attention to, pouring of your water and wine. They would never forget your steak knife or hand you a teaspoon when you required a soup spoon. You might imagine that this could be a stuffy snobby restaurant, but you’d be wrong. This is an exceptional restaurant that you can expect gracious service and divine food.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"To me, what makes Danko's the best restaurant in the City beyond the food and service; it is the consistency of the high quality of both.  The food is always excellent (if some dishes suit your taste more than others) and the wait and service staff consistently deliver a level of professionalism that I don't find anywhere else in town (I've lived here 38 years).  If you haven't been, this is a relatively small place, divided into two main rooms (one contains the bar which is a fine place to dine as well as drink).  The noise level is generally low-to-moderate depending (as everywhere) on if there's a noisy table near you.  For the quality of the food and service, the prices are reasonable, though this is certainly not an inexpensive place to dine (luckily, I'm not a wine drinker so I'm referring to just the cost of the food  and a cocktail or two).Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"This is still my favorite restaurant after all these years, since it first opened. 
I love the flexibility of their menu: one can pick the number of courses one wants and choose from all the offerings on the menu since any item can be an appetizer, or main course and one can pick all neat, all seafood n even all desserts to comprise of the different courses of one's meal.
Please don't ever change this, it is a winning formula.
The price is reasonable too, considering the quality of the food and service.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"We chose items off the a la carte menu, instead of the tasting menu, but they still offered a wine pairing for each item we selected. Very unexpected. Wines were all excellent, and most we were unfamiliar with and enjoyed trying new wines. Each dish was delightful. Service was perfect. Delightful evening!",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Excellent service with a down to earth vibe.  I ordered the duck, it was cooked just right, delicious but a large portion, couldn't finish it. We skipped dessert as we had a birthday cake at home but they still served some profiteroles and gave us a little treat to have the next morning with coffee, amazing. Worth the wait to book a reservation, plan ahead!",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Oh how I wish GD was in Chicago--a mere three hours drive from home. My wife, our daughter, and I had one of our best dinners ever. The service was excellent--friendly and professional. Each menu item was spot on. The Horseradish Crusted Salmon was one on the best entrees I ever had. My wife reported that Chicago's Branzini--which we've tried to like-- pales when compared to GD's Branzini with Fennel Purée. I could go on singing the praises of the food, but I strongly suspect that one can't go wrong. Our cocktails were artfully prepared, and we were more than happy with the recommended wines.

Gary Danko,"We visited Gary Danko on my birthday and were quite disappointed.  Service failures occurred even before we arrived with their automated reservation confirmation system.  It called me to confirm, leaving a message, and I called back , but was called again the next day by a human.  Even after confirming a second time the automated system called again requiring yet another call on my part. 

When we arrived the managers were apologetic but seated us at an undesirable table by the door. In this location I anticipated we would have people standing behind us waiting to be seated and a draft when the door was opened.  For these reasons I asked for a different table but was told I could not be accommodated in anything under an hour.  A request for another table has never previously been denied at any of the many fine Bay Area restaurants we have attended.  And, as it turned out, this location had other issues.  The space between this table and the adjacent one was barely adequate for one person to squeeze through.  The consequences of this were that a waiter taking orders from the next table would have his derriere right in my sister's face.  Also, if one of our orders came while an order was being taken by the adjacent table the servers would have to wait until the waiter was finished taking the next table's order before serving us.  Another drawback of this location was the noise level which precluded conversation at normal voice levels (unlike any of the tables we have had in the room at the back).

As for the food the quail I ordered tasted like it had been steamed with the water vapor being more prevalent than the juices of the quail.

I was told I could contact Gary Danko myself by email but he had a subordinate reply and unlike other restaurants where mishaps have occurred there was no offer either to compensate us for the poor service or to come back as their guest.  For $150 per person I expect better than this and will not choose this restaurant ever again.Read more",Overall2

Gary Danko,"Gary Danni was good, not great. 

The table at which we were seated was far too small for three tall people. It was also awkwardly close to the next table over. The waiters kept tripping on our feet and the cheese cart couldn't be moved close enough for more than a glance at a distance.

The food was passable for the price. I sincerely believe the menu is too large for the type of experience they are attempting to achieve.

The amuse was over salted. The risotto's presentation was weak, but the dish was flavorful. The portions were definitely more than expected for a five course meal. 

Most of the meal was quite flavorful. Though, the pork dish would have benefited from more greens and less meat. The cheeses selected for us were lovely.

The dessert was a travesty. The dessert on the recommended menu tasted like it sat in the fridge for a day. 

The service was attentive and welcoming. The environment is dated and the noise levels are on the higher side.Read more",Overall3

The first course - oysters with caviar - was a fitting beginning and left us wanting more (though the portion was quite small, it was mouth -watering). The salmon with horseradish crust was the best salmon I've ever had. The main entree, beef filet, was also perfectly prepared and just rare enough. The cheese course offered a host of delicious options, however, the lemon souffle cake was perfection and the perfect finish. A high point of the meal was the sommelier.

San Francisco's discerning diners seem to agree with my opinion - the restaurant was packed with a great, knowledgeable crowd. Full marks to a real San Francisco institution!",Overall5
Gary Danko,Excellent or outstanding on all accounts!!!! WOW -- one of the best martini's I have had in the past 20 years.  I was a single diner and they made me feel lke a king.  WOW --- thank you,Overall5
Gary Danko,"What an amazing time we had. Myself and a friend were visiting San Francisco and booked here for our last night, which well and truly gave the holiday a memorable ending.

I guess we had expected the food to be of a high standard, but every course exceeded our expectations, with truly stunning depths of flavour. The knowledge and assistance in choices from  the sommelier, the man in charge of the cheese trolley, and the attention to detail of all of the staff made this an absolutely unforgettable experience.

I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"Special occasion dinner with girlfriend. Service was very on point. Sommelier gave great wine suggestions and I left with a couple on my shopping shortlist. Dining room is dark and on the intimate side.

Food ranged from good to excellent. Most dishes hit the mark. One surprising miscue was the fillet. It was overcooked. In hindsight should have sent it back.

The creme brulee to finish was perfection. Pricey but you get a great meal and portions are generous. Service was professional if a tad detached.

I recommend GD for any foodies with a special occasion to celebrate. I won't be running back as there are so many other great meals to experience in the city with more personable service. That said, GD is absolutely worth trying at least once.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"One of the most amazing experiences of our lives... this one was special to my husband and myself, I'm so happy we came here to celebrate us. We had such a great time from start to finish. Came in early to Hang out before our reservations- we sat at the bar has a drink the bartender was super nice and just helpful; we then sat at an amazing setting table where you can see everyone and comfortable for two roomy for space and just great for stretching , so happy because I'm not a fan of someone listening in on the conversations.  

We were greeted then told about the menu and the courses, we chose pick your own 5 each depending on what we wanted, from meats and fish to seafood courses ere delightful and looked small but so filling and just amazing taste and quality! Then desserts were great little treats and butter cake with soufflé omg!!! Delicious with coffee and espresso! The best part was they put a bed of roses on the plate with a plate cover and opened it and it was a ring box from my husband with an upgraded ring inside, one of the most romantic things he has ever done for me and the ring was stunning, the memory Gary Danko left for me was this I'll never forget it, thank you for helping with delivering the message to me and making it an amazing dinner.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"I came here with my husband during a weekend trip to San Francisco. We booked our reservation 4 weeks in advance, and received a call to confirm the reservation a couple of days prior. We really enjoyed the service and the ambiance of the restaurant. Our waiter was fabulous, and was extremely friendly and helpful. We walked out of the restaurant stuffed from the 5 course menu selection, and were very pleased with our overall dining experience. The appetizers and desserts were great, and we even received a banana cake to enjoy the next morning for breakfast. I loved the service and the presentation of the risotto entree. The only thing we were not impressed with was the filet of beef entree. We felt the cost of the entree did not equal the value, however we still enjoyed our food and the overall experience. We would recommend this restaurant to others looking to enjoy a special occasion and fine dining in San Francisco.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,Excellent experience. Wonderful food and wine,Overall5
Gary Danko,"had eaten here some years ago and we wanted to return when we were again in San Francisco. Felt it not quite as good as last time, to be fair i think more based on cost. Food and service were excellent but price had gone up quite a bit and Aussie dollar down so for us very expensive. Could not fault food or service but would not be a go back to must if we get to San Fran again.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Wow, I mean wow.  I have know Gary Danko since he was in his twenties working for Joan Parkinson at Tucker Hill Lodge.  As a San Franciscan, I go to his restaurant several times a year.  Tonight was horrific, I mean so so bad I am still in shock.  We did a 5 course meal with wine paring. The service was slow, there were large and inconsistent gaps between courses.  Food arrived cold, embarrassingly so, with in consistent quality. In the past I have bought cases of wine based on tastings at dinner, tonight the paring was atrocious and most offerings were undrinkable and completely unrelated to the meal. We felt like we were at a pier 39 kitschy birthday dinner, far, I mean really far from fine dinning.  At $649 for dinner for two, I can tell you this was our last time at Gary Danko, a restaurant that went from a great pleasure and place of excitement, to a total embarrassment. Wow, I mean wow obviously no one is any longer running this show.Read more",Overall1
Gary Danko,I made this reservation for friends of mine that arrived from the Far East the night before. They all loved the experience and was extremely satisfied with the cuisine and the service. Bravo !,Overall5
Gary Danko,"Lovely like we remembererd. Beautiful flowers, tranquil and spotless. Service was modern, attentive and sincere. Ingredients first rate and seasonal,  focused and balanced compositions. This should be the standard but is increasingly rare now.  Purée of English peas slightly baked and salt heavy on quail. Cheeses were formidable. 

Overall so much better than some newer and more Michelined starred restaurants in SF.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,"My wife and I decided to celebrate our first wedding anniversary with a fancy dinner at Gary Danko. My wife and I are both vegetarians and I feel we did not get our money's worth in terms of the food taste. Some of the dishes were wonderful, such as the risotto, and gnocchi but others like the tofu were very disappointing.

We did the three course tasting meal and took all he entree items from the vegetarian tasting menu barring the two salads.

Service at this restaurant is extraordinary and I did not have to ask for anything except for a photo of my wife and I at the end of our dinner.

The wines offered were wonderful and they have a very exhaustive wine list. We went for wine by the glass. 

A nice finishing touch was bringing out a surprise chocolate cake without us even having to ask for it along with wonderful cake for breakfast the next day.

I wish the vegetarian options had more flavor and there are more vegetarian options included in the future. Overall a decent place to head to celebrate any event for its service, wine list, and ambiance, but I don't feel it is currently good enough for the vegetarian fare offered.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,Would only recommend if you are in a rush. We were seated and out within 1 hour and 20 minutes. Asked whether we wanted coffee or after dinner drinks as they cleared our entre dishes!! Clearly wanted the table back for someone else.At no point when we boooked did they say that they wanted the table back within a certain time. Everything was rushed. Amuse Bouche served at the same time as we were seated and given menus. Completely spoiled the evening. Food was ok although not exceptional. Will not return. when spending the kind of money Gary Danko charges I want to relax and enjoy and not made to feel like I am in a fast food restaurant. Really PoorRead more,Overall1

Gary Danko,"Absolutely fabulous food.  I had heard about and read about this restaurant for a number of years and looked forward to being able to eat here.  The service was impeccable and the surroundings very nice and quite.  It was a tough choice to determine what to order as everything looked wonderful.  Went with young children who gobbled down the delicious food including desserts.  The wine selection was excellent and all was most enjoyable.  The price is not for the faint of heart but worth every penny.  When back in San Francisco, I will want to plan far enough in advance to be able to try more of the excellent choices.  The lobster dish was out of this world and the table side banana dessert dramatic and decadent.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We were a party of four and three of the four had previously dined at Gary Danko.  The dining room was full but we were made to feel like we were the only ones there.  The
service bordered on hovering but overall the service was excellent.   Each course was a surprise of textures and flavors.     We did bring our own wine as two of the people
in our party have extensive wine cellars.   The pricing seemed very reasonable for the
quality and variation of the food choices, the excellent service and the atmosphere.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,Had a good dinner. Two of us with a bottle of wine and four courses. They got us seated and out in 90 minutes. If we put our fork down for a minute they tried to remove the plates repeatedly. If you are looking for good food and quickly than this is a good place. Otherwise not. I will most likely not go back.,Overall3
Gary Danko,Fantastic food and service.  Good place  for birthday and date.  Will come again,Overall5
Gary Danko,There were 4 of us.  I would say that 65% of the servings were considered really good.  the rest were all right.  I had heard great things about Gary Danko and was looking forward to having a 5 star meal.  I would say it's more like 3.5 to 4 star overall.   Overpriced for sure.,Overall3
Gary Danko,"My first visit to Gary Danko this past week was epic. The food, service, wine and ambience far exceeded my expectations. The Staff and Sommelier are top flight professionals and they are 100% committed to the diners satisfaction and personal preferences. Moreover, the wine list has an excellent selection of French Bordeaux's - which will be expertly decanted and served in the correct stemware. Compliments to the Chef and Kitchen Staff - the food preparations were meticulous, bright and appetizing - spectacular flavors! The value proposition is found in the whole experience - it is not inexpensive, however, it is well worth it and upon reflection you will treasure the memory of a truly great resturant.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"I took 1 star off for a little sloppy clearing, and a slight lack of cohesion, but all in all service was great, detail-oriented, and hospitality driven. All things you would expect with a Michelin starred and Relais amd Châteaux.

I also took 1 star off from the food for the salmon dish, I found it lacking the presentation and poise of the rest of the menu. Everything was delicious though, including the salmon, however. 

It was a great dinner and a great way to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday.  Thanks to both front and back of house teams that made it possible.Read more",Overall5
Gary Danko,We were in San Francisco and met friends also from out of town. After a specialty cocktail we had the five course Chef's tasting menu with the wines.

Gary Danko,"Very expensive, not the best quality on seafood. The wine list was extense but very expensive, you can find the same wines in other fine dinning restaurants, with cheaper prices.
The service was good, but in my opinion the lobster was frozen and the meat had many condiments. Not my type of restaurant.Read more",Overall2
Gary Danko,Just an absolute delight as always. Impeccable service- not too fussy but attentive. Food was outstanding and memorable.,Overall5
Gary Danko,"This was my first visit despite living in the city for over 30 years.  While I would  definitely return, it would be again for a special occasion as it was this first time.  A very dear friend was moving out of state and I expected a Gary Danko experience to give an excellent send off.  It did not disappoint and we both enjoyed the experience.  Excellent service from the very start.  Once seated the service somehow excelled and we were never left wanting for anything.   Bread plate showing low, another couple of slices of some of the most delicious bread i have ever had. The timing between courses was perfect. The staff recommendations were spot on. Our only non positive experience was the physical closeness felt by having many tables in s small area offering little to know privacy of conversation at each individual table . We both ordered the steak which, even tho my steak needed to be redone,  were both delicious. For dessert we had the banana flambé, done table side, and couldn't decide if the preparation or the dessert were better.  The dessert...:). Overall, a lovely dining experience.Read more",Overall4
Gary Danko,"No question, the food is absolutely wonderful and for that alone it is worth the visit. However, in order to allow for more diners, they have made use of every inch of floor space so that tables are very close together. It felt crowded and it's very loud. Service was spotty. When we first got seated, there were 3 or 4 people who quickly arrived to give us menus, water, etc.  We weren't even settled before we were asked to move the menus one person was handing us so that another could serve an amuse bouche. The menus are big, the table was small and it all just felt awkward and almost  overwhelming,  as another person filled water glasses and another served bread... Then nothing for a long time. Finally,  someone came to take the order but they had not explained the menu yet. Service was spotty between courses as well. The grand mariner soufflé was to die for and the muffin take away was a nice reminder of a great meal. Overall, the food is worth a visit but at this price point ($200/person), ambiance & service are important too.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Cozy setting, some dishes delicious, others highly forgettable.

Gary Danko,"We have been here three times. Every time food is delicious. Ambiance is set up to be romantic but because it is so crowded and the tables are practically right on top of each other, it doesn't end up being romantic. A bigger group was seated in the middle of the room and they were obnoxiously drunk and loud. My husband and I could not even hear each other just sitting across from one another. This was supposed to be our anniversary dinner date and we couldn't even have a conversation. Servi ice is usually great but this time around, not so much. The waiter was very sarcastic. He seemed inexperienced at waiting in fine dining restaurants. He did not attempt to make us happy. Gary Danko is not cheap. As a special request, we asked for an extra muffin because my daughters love the muffins. The waiter tells us he will check for extras because they only make enough for one per guest. He came back a couple more times to drop off the bill and take the payment but not once acknowledged our request again. Upon leaving, we asked another server and without pushback, accommodated our request. Gary Danko WAS my favorite restaurant. I love the food. Unfortunately when I look for a good restaurant, I also look into ambiance and service and Gary Danko fell short.Read more",Overall3
Gary Danko,"Gary Danko had excellent service, ambiance and the food was delicious.

Sat us in the main dining's finest booth.  Started with cocktails and mocktails.  Though we were in deep conversation, the staff never rushed us, and were very helpful and professional.  I wish all SF service was like this.  Genuinely friendly and not at all intrusive.  

The menu was unique in that you pick 3-5 courses and can choose from any of 5 options:  apps, salads, mains, deserts and something else I don't recall.  But you can actually pick 5 deserts as your options, if you wish.

Definitely recommend to all.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Almost perfect.  Three out of four courses were spectacular (the glazed oysters, coconut Thai curry and pineapple upside down cake).  Several missteps with service early on.  We hadn't been there 5 minutes, I have the dinner menu and wine menu open in front of me, and the amuse-bouche arrives, the server asking me to move the wine menu aside.  Is anyone paying attention to timing?  This restaurant has been around for a long time (and has a Michelin star) so the service should be more polished.Read more",Overall4

Gary Danko,"Spectacular food and overall service.  One recommendation only regarding service and only because I was raised within a family who was particularly aware of manners.  When a server assistant or bus person responds to a guest's -thank you- with a ""no problem""- in a high-end establishment like Gary Danko- it is noticeable and disappointing.  It just does not match the mood of this fine restaurant nor do it justice.Read more",Overall5

I was wrong-it is truly a remarkable dining experience with great ambiance. The wine list is incredible, with great values. I will definitely plan ahead and return on my next trip to San Francisco",Overall5

Gary Danko,"We were in the City and on our way to Miami the next morning and were able to get a reservation a couple months out so the timing was great.  I've heard some people say they thought Gary Danko had lost some of it's edge in the last year, but it absolutely did not disappoint for our visit.  The service was fantastic, knowledgeable, and anything but stuffy.  The wine list is incredible, especially unique is their large selection of half bottles.  The standout dish was the seafood risotto.  We have eaten risotto the world over at some of the top restaurants and this was the best we've ever had...perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I literally got hungry just writing this review and thinking about it.  With so many amazing restaurants in the City there are only a handful we repeat at and this will be on that list.Read more",Overall5

Gary Danko,"Excellent food and ambiance .  Been here several times but the last visit seemed a bit rushed.  The amuse-bouche was served underneath our menus, the cheese course was served at the same time as the dessert course and we just felt like every course was hurried along.  This has never happened before on previous visits so maybe it was just the holiday rush.",Overall4
Gary Danko,"Maybe no restaurant can live up to its hype or maybe studying reviews and menu selections can only lead to disappointment. The food did not disappoint nor did the wait staff,  but our introduction to Gary Danko's can only be described as rude. The valet  did not come over to open the passenger door for me. I guess he was too busy on his cell, so finally I got out myself. Then we stood in the rain so my husband could pay. 
My husband was celebrating his birthday, and we were thrilled to get a reservation. We went on a Tuesday evening  but were caught terrible traffic. Our daughter arrived on time 5:30 pm and explained to the hostess that  we were delayed even though we had left Lafayette at 4:30pm. The hostess told her that our table would be held for 20 minutes. When we finally arrived 19 minutes late we were shown our ""requested quiet table"" by the front door which was anything but quiet or even warm by the haughty hostess. We refused it and did get a better table.Read more",Overall4
